Soon I will be adding the 2018-2019 ring onto this trophy. This makes 12 times starting back in 2007.
The MVP program means a lot to me. So I have written a book about MVPs in both tech and sports. It will be coming out soon. I could use your help with the title.
Thanks,
David

      <description>I have been awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for a 9th time. I started off as an MIIS MVP (even though ILM had been released 4 months previous). Then I became an ILM MVP in 2008, then in 2010 it was FIM MVP (or was that 2011). Now with FIM changing to MIM and in an effort to reduce the administrative paperwork the Microsoft MVP team has every time MMS/MIIS/ILM/FIM/MIM changes names all FIM MVPs have become DS (Directory Services) MVPs.</description>

I will be presenting on why we want to get to Active Directory based on Windows Server 2012 R2 and how to get there. My fellow MVP&amp;rsquo;s will be covering the rest of the agenda. I also created an IT clue game to play in small groups where the objective is to figure out who stole the data and how it could have been prevented.</description>

      <title>8 Time MVP</title>

      <description>Today I received notification that for the 8th time (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) I have been honored by Microsoft as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP). According to the MVP web site there are currently 10 Identity Management MVP&amp;rsquo;s in the world, and only three in North America.
Looking forward to the on-going journey with this product set and wonderful friends I have made along the way, product group members (past and present), MVP&amp;rsquo;s (past and present), readers (book, blog, twitter) and other Identity Management professionals.</description>
