      <title>Open Source: Review of MIMTools</title>

      <description>JefTek created a niche hybrid tool that tackles a few pieces of the sync and service puzzle in a way that none of the others do.
One noteable one for sync:
Get and Export MIM Deltas to CSV (based on a drop file either stop and drop or the audit log dropped during the export
It is great for setting up SharePoint and the Kerberos authentication to it.
While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do all that IS4U-FIM-PowerShell (see my review), does or Lithnext resourcemanagement-powershell or Lithnet-miis-powershell (see my review), or even the he FIM PowerShell Module (see my review), it fills a small niche that none of the rest of them do.</description>

      <title>Open Source: Review of FIM 2010 PowerShell Cmdlets</title>

      <description>Gil Kirkpatrick (a great guy, fellow MVP, who has taught me a lot over the years) created one of the very first, if not the first, PowerShell commandlets libraries to manage FIM/MIM service. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t had any activity in years, but it served as a great example to get others going.
If you like this simple approach you could check out Adam Weigert&amp;rsquo;s PowerShell for FIM 2010 (see my review).</description>

      <description>Wim Beck&amp;rsquo;s IS4U-FIM-PowerShell is a great example of open source, in that he has built on top of the FIM PowerShell Module (see my review). This is what Open Source is about, building upon each other&amp;rsquo;s contributions to make great stuff!
When I looked at it in Dec 2016 I almost dismissed it since it lacked a wiki, but since then Wim has added a lot of pages. They still lack examples, I plan on pitching in to help out with that by adding some examples to my fork and then asking Wim to pull it in.</description>

      <title>Open Source: Review of Lithnet</title>

      <description>Ryan Newington&amp;rsquo;s Lithnet consists of several items:
miis-powershell
resourcemanagement-powershell
resourcemanagement-webservice
googleapps-managementagent
acma
&amp;ldquo;Codeless business rules engine for FIM/MIM&amp;rdquo;
umare
&amp;ldquo;Codeless data transform engine for FIM/MIM&amp;rdquo;
I will only review the items I know
Managing Sync
miis-powershell is amazing it can almost everything you can do through the UI. For example, Clear-FullSyncWarning and it has a great wiki. Gotta have it!
It wraps WMI calls, existing PowerShell modules, executables and sync client UI to interact with FIM/MIM Sync.</description>

      <description>PowerShell for FIM 2010 by Adam Weigert consists of three parts but I further break the last into two:
Management Agent(MA) and MetaVerse (MV) Extensions that let you run PowerShell scripts as your extensions
A Workflow Activity
A PowerShell module
Managing Sync
Managing Service
Management Agent(MA) and MetaVerse (MV) Extensions
The work done to enable you to write PowerShell scripts to be MA and MV extensions is crazy brilliant. However, I suspect (I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested) that large installations should shy away from this as compiled C# and VB.</description>

      <description>The FIM PowerShell Module (started by Craig Martin and now updated most frequently by Brian Desmond) is a great set of commandlets that help you to automate Interactions with FIM Service and FIM Sync Service.
Managing Sync
This library is great for automating tests. This library and Ryan Newington&amp;rsquo;s Lithnet-Miis-PowerShell (see my review on LithNet) are very complimentary. You can retrieve CS Objects, Run History, start an MA.
I found that the most interesting Sync related Cmdlets are the</description>
