      <description>Last summer I attended and spoke at the Cloud Identity Summit in Chicago. First big news: it was renamed to Identiverse and 2018 will be in Boston. As a consultant I have limited time to attend conferences and speak. So conferences have to be great. I do love this one, but in the interest of time, I will be skipping it this year in favor of speaking at the European Identity Conference in May 2018 in Munich, Germany.</description>

      <description>At last year&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Identity Summit in Vail I heard a lot about how the password is dead. I expect to hear a lot more this year.
Most of it fit into one of several categories:
Complaints about why passwords should be dead
In other words all of the various problems with passwords &amp;ndash; and there are
Schemes to have various applications depend on someone else&amp;rsquo;s password
While this is helpful it doesn&amp;rsquo;t kill the password</description>
