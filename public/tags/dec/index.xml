      <description>On Monday, Nov 5th, and Tuesday the 6th I will be attending and speaking at the Hybrid Identity Protection (HIP) Conference in NYC. On Monday at 4 PM I will be giving an updated version of Top Lessons Learned from Disasters in Identity Management as well as a sneakÂ peek of my new book, How to be an MVP in Life.
I am very excited to attend this conference. Thanks to Darren Mar-Elia and Micky Bresman at Semperis for putting it all together.</description>
