      <description>After re-reading my earlier post on this subject I decided I could be clearer.
GUIDs are often used in three different formats:
Representation
Example
Canonical form
8c4ac332-975f-4717-ad7b-ba4a4e968fff
Octet String
32c34a8c5f971747ad7bba4a4e968fff
Base64 Encoded
MsNKjF+XF0ete7pKTpaP/w==
Representation
Comment
Used in
Canonical form
This format stems from the way GUIDs (UUIDs) are generated. Each dash separating the various components. In version one of the UUID specification, the first the last component was the MAC address of the computer that generated the GUID.</description>

      <description>TEC 2009 continues onto the last day.
Joel Silver spoke on his efforts and plans to implement ILM 2 for Microsoft. He presented a very interesting workflow to show how he addressed the challenge of creating unique email aliases.
Then I listened to Felix as he discussed some of the interesting aspects of LDAP enhancements from around the vendorscape (I think I just made that word up).
