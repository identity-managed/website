      <description>Last week I taught a group of students 50382A Implementing Forefront Identity Manager 2010, and referenced FIM Best Practices Volume 1 to supplement. It was a great bunch, full of humor. We even had one gentleman fly all the way from Australia to attend my class. I felt quite honored.
Well due to popular demand we are going to run it again May 23-May 26 (M-Th) once more in downtown Phoenix.</description>
