      <description>Well, we are on our way towards our goal of $2000, but we need more help (please make a donation).
Refresher:
Every year Ensynch sponsor’s the Ensynch Stairclimb and Firefighter challenge. The purpose of the event is to raise money for research on Cystic Fibrosis. The event is this Saturday, in Phoenix at Arizona Center - 5th Street &amp;amp; Van Buren. This year I am heading up the Stripes team, we have a goal of raising $2000 by this Saturday.</description>

Many of our team mates at Ensynch will be climbing stairs. If you live in Phoenix or will be here this Saturday you can participate too (you can climb or come and cheer as part of the no-sweat supporters).</description>
