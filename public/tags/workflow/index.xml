      <description>Over the years since FIM was first beta&amp;rsquo;d as ILM2 we have seen some cool workflows be released to open source. This is my review of the workflows I can find that are open source. First let me salute everyone who has contributed to the FIM and MIM community with these big undertakings. That said I am trying to give guidance to my readers as to what is the most useful in various situations and so I will make specific recommendations.</description>

      <description>My colleague Joe Zamora, a talented developer, who has been instrumental in helping us advance our knowledge of custom workflows, has just launched his own blog: CShark.
His first post is on how to &amp;ldquo;Generate AccountName in ILM2 custom workflow activity&amp;rdquo; and it came in response to a question in the ILM 2 connect forum entitled:Â Custom Workflow Activity to Generate samAccountName.
Go Joe Go!

      <description>Very nice David, I would also urge readers to chec&amp;hellip; Brad Turner - Sep 3, 2008
Very nice David, I would also urge readers to check out Mark Gabarra&amp;rsquo;s blog for information relating WF and ILM 2. I also hope that we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to goad our own Paul Divan into bringing his experiences to the blogosphere!</description>

      <description>So by now all of you know that understanding Windows Workflow Foundation is going to be quite helpful in implementing ILM 2.
Having lived 9 of the last 12 months in Redmond, WA, I now understand a lot more about sprinkling
So I thought I would provide a sprinkling of understanding about Windows Workflow Foundation: a categorization of the built in workflows.
