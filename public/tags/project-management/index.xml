      <description>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be on a project that was managed by Darth Vader?
In Part 1 I analyzed the good side of his skills. In Part 2 I tried to find the bad but I only find more good.
Once more thanks to George Lucas for inventing Star Wars and thanks again my co-workers for not utilizing Darth Vader&amp;rsquo;s style.

      <description>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be on a project that was managed by Darth Vader? Let’s analyze the good side of his skills.
But before we do a little housekeeping:
I would like to thank my George Lucas for inventing such wonderful characters and a wonderful story, that has entertained me and so many others, many many times. I would also like to thank my co-workers for not utilizing Darth Vader&amp;rsquo;s style.</description>
