      <description>For years I have been trying to predict the future of Identity Management, but every time I look in my crystal ball it is just too cloudy to see anything. In fact anytime I look in my crystal ball on just about any technology topic the only thing it shows me are clouds! I was beginning to think it was broken.

      <description>The article on Password Sync for Office 365 is interesting news and clearly states that Federated users can&amp;rsquo;t have their password&amp;rsquo;s synced. In the Community Additions many curious users asked their questions treating it as a forum. Well here are my responses:
If you do Password Sync do you still need ADFS or any other SSO tool that works with Office365? Password Sync gives you the ability to login to Office365 using the same username and password that you use with your Active Directory.</description>

      <description>Carol presented a solution to a very thorny problem – how to overcome the lack of delegation in BPOS. In BPOS a user is either an admin or a user. So she used FIM to provide the delegation. Very detailed, very complete solution. She illustrated some of the scripts she has posted on her blog such as http://www.wapshere.com/missmiis/a-script-to-create-sets-and-mprs-from-templates Well done Carol!
