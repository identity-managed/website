      <title>Revisiting GUIDs, Octets and Base64</title>

      <description>After re-reading my earlier post on this subject I decided I could be clearer.
GUIDs are often used in three different formats:
Representation
Example
Canonical form
8c4ac332-975f-4717-ad7b-ba4a4e968fff
Octet String
32c34a8c5f971747ad7bba4a4e968fff
Base64 Encoded
MsNKjF+XF0ete7pKTpaP/w==
Representation
Comment
Used in
Canonical form
This format stems from the way GUIDs (UUIDs) are generated. Each dash separating the various components. In version one of the UUID specification, the first the last component was the MAC address of the computer that generated the GUID.</description>

      <description>A while back I needed to set up Property Sets in AD LDS for granting of permissions to many of the attributes on the person object all at once, as I reviewed the Technet documentation on AD Property Sets I realized that it doesn’t tell you what object type property sets are, nor does it tell you how to create a property set, nor does it tell you how to assign an attribute to a property set.</description>
