      <description>While using FIM and PowerShell to manage Exchange 2010 I was following along a wonderful article on resource mailboxes that left me wondering a few things.
Exactly how is the data stored in the msExchResourceDisplay and msExchResourceSearchProperties attributes?
How is it stored with multiple custom properties?
Is manipulating those AD attributes sufficient or is PowerShell storing something in the Exchange Data store?
Here are the answers:
msExchResourceDisplay = “Room,FlatScreenTV” It appears to be a single valued string with commas.</description>
