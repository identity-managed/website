      <title>SharePoint Foundation 2013 IIS Configuration Error</title>
      <link>https://identitymanaged.com/2018/03/sharepoint-foundation-2013-iis.html</link>

      <description>SharePoint is a great product but I wish that FIM and MIM did not use it. In my opinion, it adds unnecessary infrastructure and really complicates the setup, because SharePoint must be installed and configured (and maintained). Leaving that aside, allow me to point out some gotchas that might impede your ability to install this MIM/FIM prerequisite.
First up: if your server has limited access to the Internet you should probably download all of these prerequisites and copy them to the server &amp;ndash; because that&amp;rsquo;s what the SharePoint Installer has to do &amp;ndash; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t include these items.</description>

      <description>JefTek created a niche hybrid tool that tackles a few pieces of the sync and service puzzle in a way that none of the others do.
One noteable one for sync:
Get and Export MIM Deltas to CSV (based on a drop file either stop and drop or the audit log dropped during the export
It is great for setting up SharePoint and the Kerberos authentication to it.
While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do all that IS4U-FIM-PowerShell (see my review), does or Lithnext resourcemanagement-powershell or Lithnet-miis-powershell (see my review), or even the he FIM PowerShell Module (see my review), it fills a small niche that none of the rest of them do.</description>

      <description>Gil Kirkpatrick (a great guy, fellow MVP, who has taught me a lot over the years) created one of the very first, if not the first, PowerShell commandlets libraries to manage FIM/MIM service. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t had any activity in years, but it served as a great example to get others going.
If you like this simple approach you could check out Adam Weigert&amp;rsquo;s PowerShell for FIM 2010 (see my review).</description>

      <description>Wim Beck&amp;rsquo;s IS4U-FIM-PowerShell is a great example of open source, in that he has built on top of the FIM PowerShell Module (see my review). This is what Open Source is about, building upon each other&amp;rsquo;s contributions to make great stuff!
When I looked at it in Dec 2016 I almost dismissed it since it lacked a wiki, but since then Wim has added a lot of pages. They still lack examples, I plan on pitching in to help out with that by adding some examples to my fork and then asking Wim to pull it in.</description>

      <description>Ryan Newington&amp;rsquo;s Lithnet consists of several items:
miis-powershell
resourcemanagement-powershell
resourcemanagement-webservice
googleapps-managementagent
acma
&amp;ldquo;Codeless business rules engine for FIM/MIM&amp;rdquo;
umare
&amp;ldquo;Codeless data transform engine for FIM/MIM&amp;rdquo;
I will only review the items I know
Managing Sync
miis-powershell is amazing it can almost everything you can do through the UI. For example, Clear-FullSyncWarning and it has a great wiki. Gotta have it!
It wraps WMI calls, existing PowerShell modules, executables and sync client UI to interact with FIM/MIM Sync.</description>

      <description>PowerShell for FIM 2010 by Adam Weigert consists of three parts but I further break the last into two:
Management Agent(MA) and MetaVerse (MV) Extensions that let you run PowerShell scripts as your extensions
A Workflow Activity
A PowerShell module
Managing Sync
Managing Service
Management Agent(MA) and MetaVerse (MV) Extensions
The work done to enable you to write PowerShell scripts to be MA and MV extensions is crazy brilliant. However, I suspect (I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested) that large installations should shy away from this as compiled C# and VB.</description>

      <description>The FIM PowerShell Module (started by Craig Martin and now updated most frequently by Brian Desmond) is a great set of commandlets that help you to automate Interactions with FIM Service and FIM Sync Service.
Managing Sync
This library is great for automating tests. This library and Ryan Newington&amp;rsquo;s Lithnet-Miis-PowerShell (see my review on LithNet) are very complimentary. You can retrieve CS Objects, Run History, start an MA.
I found that the most interesting Sync related Cmdlets are the</description>

      <title>Is MIM dead? Not yet!</title>

      <description>From time to time I hear people wonder if MIM is dead.
Why do people ask?
They don&amp;rsquo;t feel like they have heard a good road map recently They aren&amp;rsquo;t seeing the improvements they hoped for They aren&amp;rsquo;t paying attention to the actions of the product group Why do I say it isn&amp;rsquo;t dead yet?
While the Cloud Identity is the future, we are and will be in hybrid identity for a long time and MIM is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s key component to that.</description>

      <description>Over the years since FIM was first beta&amp;rsquo;d as ILM2 we have seen some cool workflows be released to open source. This is my review of the workflows I can find that are open source. First let me salute everyone who has contributed to the FIM and MIM community with these big undertakings. That said I am trying to give guidance to my readers as to what is the most useful in various situations and so I will make specific recommendations.</description>

      <description>Have you ever found out that attribute flow precedence is messed up, wrong or otherwise in error just after you followed the steps to migrate your MIM/FIM configuration from Dev to Prod or vice-versa? Well I am finally blogging about a discovery I made. The list of steps (reproduced below from the above link) are incomplete:

      <description>In using the SharePoint MA from Steve Kean I noticed that some of the fields I imported were coming in with some extra noise or crap at the beginning:
String;#164
All I really wanted was the 164. While I can use the Word function in a sync rule to get past it
Word(strAttribute,2,&amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;) I really would prefer to bypass it altogether.
Well thanks to Jermaine Snipe I found why this happens and how to bypass it:</description>

      <description>At various times in my 10 years of Identity Management Consulting and 25 years working in the IT industry I have been asked to clean up various messes generated by those before me. Some of those messes involved disk failure or other issues that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be completely prevented. But some involved automated process that didn&amp;rsquo;t check their inputs.
If garbage into a computer gives you garbage out, then garbage into an automated process that doesn&amp;rsquo;t check its inputs gives you a meltdown!</description>

      <description>Recently, I needed to take Longitude and Latitude data that was given to me in the following format and break it into its individual components and then flow it out to AD.
Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose the data looks like this:
&amp;ldquo;Point -10.1223 45.945&amp;rdquo;
I could just use the Left and Right functions to get out the Longitude and Latitude.
The problem was it could also look like this depending on the level of precision:</description>

      <description>Back in 2013 I published 5 posts about the Secrets of the Metaverse:
Parts 1-5:
What is the Metaverse? How is the Metaverse data stored? Is there a limit to how many Metaverse attributes I can have? Has access to the metaverse gotten faster with recent releases? How do I safely query the metaverse? Added (Aug 5 2015): How Many Metaverse Attributes can I have? The third post was about how many attributes you can have in the Metaverse in which I said that the mms_metaverse_lineageguid table limits us to 502 single valued non-reference attributes in the Metaverse.</description>

      <description>MIM 2016 is now available
MIM &amp;ndash; Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 builds on and replaces Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2.
On Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s site they include an introductory (2 min) video about Hybrid Identity but don&amp;rsquo;t mistake that for the MIM UI.
So has anything been removed?
No. While the list of deprecated features are still deprecated none of them have been removed from this new version.
So what&amp;rsquo;s new?</description>

      <description>I have been awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for a 9th time. I started off as an MIIS MVP (even though ILM had been released 4 months previous). Then I became an ILM MVP in 2008, then in 2010 it was FIM MVP (or was that 2011). Now with FIM changing to MIM and in an effort to reduce the administrative paperwork the Microsoft MVP team has every time MMS/MIIS/ILM/FIM/MIM changes names all FIM MVPs have become DS (Directory Services) MVPs.</description>

      <description>With the latest hotfix MSFT now supports running PCNS on Windows Server 2012 R2. FIM still should not be installed on Windows Server 2012 R2 (2012 yes, 2008 R2 yes, 2008 yes). Only PCNS can be installed on Windows Server 2012 R2. The hotfix article has a slight error indicating that it is ok to install FIM Sync Service on 2012 R2 if you have installed the hotfix PCNS on 2012 R2 &amp;ndash; not true (the article should get corrected soon).</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the internet
Not an identity was stirring, not even a Passport .NET
The user accounts requests were submitted with care
Hoping that their access would soon be there
The users were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of being able to do their jobs danced in their heads
The servers and computers were in sleep mode
Awaiting someone to move a mouse and send the wake up code</description>

      <description>An easy way to take care for your FIM databases is to &amp;ldquo;use Ola Hallengren&amp;rsquo;s script (http://ola.hallengren.com/scripts/MaintenanceSolution.sql). Download the script, adjust the backup paths and run the script on each instance of SQL Server. It will automatically create several jobs some for maintaining the system databases and some for maintain the user databases. You will need to create schedules for each of the jobs.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; FIM Best Practices Volume 1</description>

      <description>Years ago, I walked into the client site a few months into an Identity Management project, and the PM told me his account had been deactivated by mistake as an employee with the same last name and same first initial was terminated, and they termed his account by mistake.
Ironic.
A few years before that I visited a client whose VP of HR had his account disabled when they let the janitor go.</description>

In some environments, like government, having that local SQL means a whole different security profile&amp;hellip;a lot of security groups aren&amp;rsquo;t going to make a distinction between that local SQL and Full Blown SQL when they scan the system since they use some of the same binaries.

      <description>Last week the Product group announced the new name for FIM and MIM&amp;rsquo;s the word Microsoft Identity Manager.
Of course as a good futurist I had made enough guesses that I got this one right, even though as an honest man I must admit I also had it wrong &amp;ndash; Azure is not part of the name.
Fortunately, they didn&amp;rsquo;t go with APE nor AILMENT, nor MIME, nor MIAMI, nor MICE, nor MAIM, nor WIMP.</description>

      <description>Recently, a reader reached out to me for advice on learning FIM, SQL and IIS. As well as guidance on setting up a lab (more advice on that part in a later post).
First think for a moment about your best learning styles for technology. Do you need to read the concepts and architecture first and then do it? Do you need to watch a video and then read, and then do it?</description>

      <description>For years I have been trying to predict the future of Identity Management, but every time I look in my crystal ball it is just too cloudy to see anything. In fact anytime I look in my crystal ball on just about any technology topic the only thing it shows me are clouds! I was beginning to think it was broken.
But then, yesterday, I watched Andreas Kjellman present at the FIM user group</description>

      <description>If one of your AD domains has a NetBios domain name that doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the leftmost part of your FQDN you need to have the Replicating Directory Changes permission given to your AD MA account. This is documented in a few places including my book. However, DirSync misses this step. Normally, Dirsync does a very good job of installing and configuring everything which you need without needing you to be an expert in FIM, but this is one thing it misses.</description>

I see two challenges:
1. There is not feature parity between the two types of sync rules
2. The imperative support (VBA) in the new sync rules is limited and difficult to debug
My wish is that we had better extensibility in the new sync rules (scrap VBA, or figure out how to improve the extensibility and debugging).</description>

      <description>Michael Pearn from down under wrote about his experience trying to use just Declarative Sync Rules
His experience &amp;ndash; especially the religious debates are similar to my own. It made me recall my presentation at TEC 2012 the FIM 2010 R2 Showdown: Classic vs. Declarative
The vast majority of old hands at the presentation declared for Classic both before and after the presentation. During the presentation I attempted to view anything you could do without code as declarative whether it came from a sync rule or not, especially if it was a new feature.</description>

All 7 times I have received the award for my &amp;ldquo;outstanding contributions in Forefront Identity Manager technical communities&amp;rdquo; and its predecessors.
In 2007 despite the product rename Identity Lifecycle Manager (ILM) 2007 the MVP award was for Microsoft Identity Integration Server (MIIS) 2003.</description>

      <description>If you are looking at the XML export of the FIM synchronization config and you are trying to track down which sync rule is supplying a particular flow you just need to know which numbers lead you where.
For example:
The key to finding the Sync rule is of course the Sync rule ID. However, this is not the resource ID that I can search for in the FIM Portal. Rather this is the metaverse ID.</description>

      <description>In addition to the official reference for functions I thought I would update my examples from back in the ILM 2 Beta days
Function Name
BitAnd
Parameters
mask Type: Integer
flag Type: Integer
Description
BitAnd is a bitwise operation anding mask and flag. So if Flag is the UserAccountControl Attribute in AD and mask is **-3
**(the 64-bit two&amp;rsquo;s complement of 2) Then the result is that the disable bit (bit 2) is turned off leaving all of the other bits unchanged.</description>

      <description>In Part 1 of How to import the Domain attribute into the FIM Portal I provided you the simple technique for the single domain forest, and the technique that works although is a bit unwieldy – that of looking at the first 41 characters of the object’s SID and using a lookup table through nested IIF statements and this doesn’t .
What if there was a simpler way?
What about using the Domain Component option in the attribute flow?</description>

      <description>If you have a single domain forest then you should use a constant flow in your sync rule or advanced attribute flow. If you have a multi-domain forest, then using a constant in the advanced attribute flow won’t work.
You could create multiple inbound sync rules one for each domain with scoping filters and then use a constant. However, this seems like a waste.
You could also follow the guidance provided in article originated by my friend Markus Vilcinskas and maintained by the community http://social.</description>

Along with FIM 2010 R2 it looks like the BHOLD Suite is available too! Although you can see that it appears to be a separate download.
I don’t know when the retail version will be available.

      <description>FIM User Interface Implementation: Replace the rigid RCDC with a customizable UI
Speaker: Eihab Isaac
Eihab delivered a very well-reasoned presentation on the pros and cons of replacing some of the forms, especially the create person (user) form. Excellent demo showing creating multiple requests for creating the user as well as requests for additional attributes, and application access. Great session.

      <description>Craig’s session is on how to get data out from the FIM Service and FIM Sync with PowerShell and displaying it with SSRS, which he has dubbed Scissors!
Ok Craig we get it! You have even persuaded me that PowerShell is important! I have started writing scripts. SQL Server of course is still important.
Key is to hook up a pipeline from PowerShell to pass into his custom SSRS PowerShell Data Processing Extension (DPE).</description>

      <description>Carol Wapshere delivered an excellent session yesterday at TEC 2012 on the thought process for migrating from MIIS/ILM to FIM.
I loved the incisive logic to focus on the main issue being solved: getting the customer onto supported software (getting the MIIS database off SQL 2000, getting off MIIS/ILM). Avoid the temptation to try and fix everything else at the same time. She had a great list of gotchas. Even more impressive were her discovery scripts designed to analyze the existing implementations and her rubric for estimating the work.</description>

Neat indeed. They are at the forefront of FIM automation, since they use the FIM Service component to automate the FIM Sync service. AFAIK they are the reason this automation functionality exists in the FIM Service at all.</description>

      <description>The SharePoint 2010 User Profile Synchronization Service is really FIM 2010 pre-packaged in a very special way. Need evidence? Look at the tables in User Profile Service Application_SyncDB
See how it has mms_connectorspace, mms_cs_link etc. Those are table commonly found in the FIM sync database. See the attributeInternal, the BindingInternal, all of the Membership* tables those are all part of the FIM Service database. So interestingly enough they have both FIM Service and FIM sync merged into a single DB.</description>

      <description>Well I delivered my session FIM 2010 R2 Showdown: Classic vs. Declarative. During lunch they changed the location. But the room was packed by 5 min after I began (guessing about 45-50 people). Many familiar faces.
We had a rollicking good time. I presented how things worked with Classic and Declarative presented some findings and asked for other opinions. Boy did I receive them.
My basic conclusion is that Declarative can reduce the code used and in turn improve the maintainability of the FIM implementation.</description>

      <description>When using the uocListView control in the FIM RCDC you can have it return a list of objects. However when you open them, they also open for viewing, not editing.
The key to this is to add a button control inside the uocListView control. You then specify the redirectURL property for the button. Additionally ShowActionBar must be true, ItemClickBehavior must be ModelessDialog (which is the default). Enable Selection must also be true.</description>

      <description>FIM has two databases (well three if we count the FIM Certificate Management service):
FIMService FIMSynchronizationService Here is a calculator in excel that you can download and use to calculate how big to make your databases.
In my experience the FIMService database size depends mostly on how many request objects are in the database.
The FIM Sync Database depends mostly on how much run history details (step object details) you generate and keep.</description>

      <description>FIM 2010 Update Rollup 2 is now available. Download from here
Before blindly applying this update it is critical that you read the release notes, as XMA&amp;rsquo;s or ECMA&amp;rsquo;s may not run after the update. If you changed the MIISServer.exe.config file to tweak the FIM MA performance the update won&amp;rsquo;t replace your file. So you have to make some updates to it by hand. This is documented in the release notes.</description>

      <description>Ok I am not actually swearing, nor are those substitute words, rather % and _ are two characters that until hotfix rollup package (build 4.0.3594.2) could be used to perform some much needed and cool searches for sets, search scopes, groups and 3rd party client queries against FIM. Such as querying for the presence of string attributes.
I am sure what happened is that someone created a resource with an underscore in the name and then couldn’t search for it.</description>

      <guid>https://identitymanaged.com/2011/06/fim-bug-for-multi-valued-strings-that.html</guid>
      <description>I think I found a bug in FIM Version 4.0.3576.2 take a look:
It appears that when you have a multi-valued string attribute when you add more than 1 value at a time and you need approval to create the object or to update the attribute, the request will fail. In the event log you will see an error (UnwillingToPerformException … CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement terminated because a duplicate key was found for the object).</description>

      <description>Rebecca, a fellow Ensynchian, presented at TEC 2011 on the limitations of the standard out of the box SQL Management and how she overcame them by writing a very fast eXtensible Management Agent (XMA).
First attempt use ado.net sql reader to read data (really fast) and write one row at a time to the AVP file (but that gets slow when dealing with large data sets).
Second attempt use the T-SQL “FOR XML” clause to transform the data to XML and then use an XSLT to transform to LDIF.</description>

      <title>RCDC Editor</title>

      <guid>https://identitymanaged.com/2011/06/rcdc-editor.html</guid>
      <description>As previously discussed the RCDC is a very powerful tool for customizing FIM without writing your own front-end and web client. There are several drawbacks to the RCDC. The worst is that you have to export the RCDC to an xml file, open it up in your favorite XML editor, modify it by hand, load it back into the FIM Portal and then run iisreset. All of which means that mistakes are quite painful, as it can take you several minutes to discover your mistake.</description>

      <guid>https://identitymanaged.com/2011/06/rcdc-requiring-another-field.html</guid>
      <description>Ok I just had to blog this.
I created a custom resource type in FIM for resource mailboxes (Room and Equipment) with accompanying RCDC’s. Based on a Boolean attribute I hide or make visible a tab of info about Room resources on the edit and view RCDC’s. (You can’t do that to the create RCDC because the object doesn’t yet exist)
But, I would like to make room number on the Hidden tab to be required when the tab is visible, and not when the tab isn’t.</description>

      <description>At Tech Ed Atlanta Brjann Brekkan and Mark Wahl discussed FIM 2010 R2 in a public forum – so here is a lot of info that is now in the public forum.
Mark covered the new items that will come out in R2:
Web Based Password reset (no need for a domain joined computer, no need to install Password Client no need for Active X, support for Firefox)
Although for integration with the GINA (the login screen) you still need to install the FIM Password Reset Client</description>

      <guid>https://identitymanaged.com/2011/05/behind-scenes-of-roomresourcescustom.html</guid>
      <description>While using FIM and PowerShell to manage Exchange 2010 I was following along a wonderful article on resource mailboxes that left me wondering a few things.
Exactly how is the data stored in the msExchResourceDisplay and msExchResourceSearchProperties attributes?
How is it stored with multiple custom properties?
Is manipulating those AD attributes sufficient or is PowerShell storing something in the Exchange Data store?
Here are the answers:
msExchResourceDisplay = “Room,FlatScreenTV” It appears to be a single valued string with commas.</description>

      <description>Carol presented a solution to a very thorny problem – how to overcome the lack of delegation in BPOS. In BPOS a user is either an admin or a user. So she used FIM to provide the delegation. Very detailed, very complete solution. She illustrated some of the scripts she has posted on her blog such as http://www.wapshere.com/missmiis/a-script-to-create-sets-and-mprs-from-templates Well done Carol!

      <description>Jeremy and Craig had an interesting shoot out showing off their differing versions of reporting from FIM. Jeremy has an “agent” that he uses to pull the data out of FIM and store it in SQL, after which doing SSRS reports is not terribly difficult. Craig’s approach was to start off by creating a generic SSRS Data Processing extension for PowerShell, and then adjusted to pull data from FIM. Both approaches look very slick.</description>

      <description>After I introduced Brad Turner and turned the time over to him, he showed off some really cool FIM extensions to enable RBAC. He even showed how it fits the NIST RBAC definitions even through level 3.
The key design decision was to extend the Set and Group objects. The Set then functions as a role. This allows for both explicit and criteria based membership. A new object type for a Role Membership allows for the user’s membership in a role to expire at an individual time.</description>

      <description>I had a lot of fun presenting this session. Largely based on chapter 5 in volume 1 I showed how to decide on your High availability approach, how that impacts your topology choice, and then how to estimate your scale, load, and complexity points. Then based on those factors figure out how big to make your SQL Server that hosts the FIM service database.
In the middle I did enjoy putting in a plug for our Ensynch sponsored green, dishwasher safe water bottles, as I took a drink of my fruit punch Gatorade mix.</description>

      <title>Creating Management Agents with the new EZMA (Andreas Kjellman)</title>
      <link>https://identitymanaged.com/2011/04/creating-management-agents-with-new.html</link>

      <guid>https://identitymanaged.com/2011/04/creating-management-agents-with-new.html</guid>
      <description>At TEC 2011, Andreas Kjellman of Microsoft, who “owns” the FIM synchronization engine, showed off the upcoming EZMA framework.
The problem:
The existing eXtensible Management Agent (XMA) does not have a call based import method, we are limited to using GUIDs as the initial anchors, and we don’t have partitions in an XMA.
Solution
EZMA – which, IMO, will actually be a little harder to do than an XMA but will allow the developer to do much more that will make the FIM admin’s life easier.</description>

      <description>James Booth former Microsoft Group Program Manager for MIIS (precursor to FIM) presented on using PowerShell to process files in preparation for consumption by FIM.
James points out that “In the beginning, it was all files.” These call based MA’s are the new kids on the block, also said that at Microsoft in 2000 the philosophy was “XML is the answer, now what is your question?”

      <description>Overall TEC 2010 Europe in Dusseldorf Germany was pretty cool. I enjoyed the speakers reception on Sunday night and got to meet some folks from the SharePoint side some of whom are even interested in FIM and one of them bought my book!
For the first time I was able to bring my wife along to TEC! We enjoyed some good time in Dusseldorf including seeing Schloss (Palace) Benrather.
Monday we started off with a keynote from Uday Hegde and Mark Wahl on the future of Directory and Identity Technologies.</description>

      <description>Here is what the text on page 183 should say (the italicized items are the new or changed bits of text)
Unattended Install of the FIM Client This is the component that you will perhaps most desperately see the need for unattended install.
Use the following table to help you plan your install as well as to understand the relationship between the UI parameters, the Unattended parameters and where these items are persisted.</description>

Could you post a complete listing of the corrections? In particular, the changes around the unattended client install. BTW, great job on Volume 1. I&amp;rsquo;m, looking forward to Volume 2 (and an eBook version would be great as well).
I love volume 1! Is it too soon to start asking about volume 2 :-)

      <description>Using FIM 2010 RTM Update 1:
The default GalSync Connector Filter is to filter out user objects that are hidden from the addressbook, OR missing the legacyExchangeDN, OR missing both the msExchangeHomeServerName and targetAddress are missing, OR proxyAddresses are missing, OR if it is a Mailbox Plan, Arbitration Mailbox, or Discovery Mailbox.
Consequently, this answers the question are mail-enabled users filtered out by default?
No they are not, as a mail-enabled user will have the target address populated, and none of the other rules will filter it out.</description>

      <description>I just found a very intriguing blog post from Thomas Vuylsteke, about a potential danger when moving your FIM Service Database from SQL Server to another: The case of the new attributes that didn’t want to be found
In short there is the potential that when you move the database that it might arrive on the new server with the Full Text Indexing disabled. The way Thomas tumbled to the problem was that he couldn’t search for a new attribute.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll order it immediately.
Congrats, any chance of an ebook?
Dan,
I considered the e-book route, but at least for the time being decided to go with a printed version. Feel free to lobby and persuade me why an ebook version would be better.
Thanks for the orders!
Ordered!
I was hoping there&amp;rsquo;d be an eBook for instant gratification and keyword search.</description>

      <description>Early last week I sent the book out for review. I have been digesting the excellent feedback I have gotten (thanks to Peter Geelen, Paul Loonen, Andreas Kjellman, and Glenn Zuckerman). Apparently, they liked Brad’s architecture diagrams more than mine (so do I) so I need to update the other architecture diagrams to be like his. They really do look neater.

Hi David,
I have a dependent sync rule and I have confirmed that it will not disconnect the object when the dependent sync rule is removed. However, everytime the dependent sync rule is removed, FIM tries to export a &amp;ldquo;Provisioning Delete/Add&amp;rdquo; to AD. Have you experienced this issue? Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks</description>

      <description>Recently, I discovered that under certain conditions the removal of a dependent sync rule could cause the disconnection of objects in AD or other connected data sources. So I had to investigate the inner workings of dependent Sync Rules to uncover this mystery and fix it.
FIM allows us to create dependent Sync Rules. First let me explain the what and then a little why. Then allow me to explain a bug that I discovered and how to work around it.</description>

      <description>Lessons learned:
Run the Do a FIM MA account configuration quick test script.
Always refresh the schema of the FIM MA using the real FIM MA Service Account which we usually call svc-FIMMA.
Scenario:
You have just modified the schema of FIM Service by creating a new Boolean attribute and have bound it to the user resource type. You refresh the FIM Schema, select the new attribute setup a direct export attribute flow from the corresponding Boolean metaverse attribute to the FIM MA attribute.</description>

      <description>A little while ago I encountered some rather strange behavior of a Set vs. the XPATH query in FIM 2010.
Using the Export-FIMConfig with the -onlyBaseResources -CustomConfig switches I run the following query to see if there are any users without a DisplayName
/Person[not(starts-with(DisplayName,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;))]
It showed 20
So then I created a set, called “~ People with no displayname”, with that as the custom filter. I checked it doesn&amp;rsquo;t violate any of the limitations listed in the Business Policy Modeling doc (which I must say is a pretty good doc)</description>

The longer version will come out a bit later. Short version, long version makes me feel kind of like I am figure skating in the Olympics. Thank you to Brjann Brekkan, Mark Wahl, Joe Schulman, Darryl Russi, Jack Kabat and Andreas Kjellman for their support, editing, eluciations on blogs and encouragement on this paper.</description>

      <title>FIM Pitfall for old ILM hands</title>

      <description>In the days of MIIS 2003 and ILM 2007 we usually wrote our provisioning code to provision a new AD account only when the particular metaverse object didn’t already have any connectors in the AD connector space. With FIM your outbound synchronization rule is quite happy to provision another AD account if the existing one it is joined to doesn’t meet the relationship criteria. So I have usually been in the habit of not worrying about extraneous provisioning if I already had an account connected to that metaverse object.</description>

      <title>Final Update for FIM RC1 released</title>

      <guid>https://identitymanaged.com/2010/02/final-update-for-fim-rc1-released.html</guid>
      <description>On Friday the product group released Update 3 for Forefront Identity Manager 2010 RC1 available through connect
https://connect.microsoft.com/site433/Downloads
Major changes as part of Update 3 (my regurgitation and comments from the release notes):
Fewer trips to the FIM Service event log – since the FIM MA export errors will now show up in the Synchronization Service Manager! Hallelujah! Less need for custom old style code Now more than 1 MA can be authoritative for deleting an object (resource) New functions for Sync Rules (Declarative Provisioning) – I guess I will have to update my function cheatsheet Null – not certain what they mean by this – null out the value or let another sync rule provide the value.</description>

      <title>FIM RCDC explained in brief</title>

      <guid>https://identitymanaged.com/2009/11/fim-rcdc-explained-in-brief.html</guid>
      <description>In this post I attempt to give you the reader a quick overview of how the FIM RCDC works conceptually. As for the mechanics of modifying the RCDC the nearly complete but growing collection of documents downloadable from MSFT will suffice.
As you will recall FIM is the new abbreviation for ILM, since it has been renamed Forefront Identity Manager, and RCDC is the Resource Control Display Configuration formerly known as the Object Visualization Configuration (OVC).</description>

      <description>Thanks to Darryl Russi for answering my questions in my earlier post An Update to FIM RC1 where I was asked about something I had read in the release notes:
Some of those items raise a few questions, like how to setup a FIM service that only takes requests from the sync service? Do we setup multiple FIM Service instances and then configure the FIM MA to talk to one of them, and not make that one available to web clients?</description>

      <description>Microsoft has posted an update to FIM RC 1, dated Nov 6.
It looks like this update covers pretty much everywhere except Certificate Services (sorry Brian and Paul).
The Release notes included in the download lists the follow improvements:
Query and Sets
Resolved a number of issues that resulted in incorrect dynamic set membership.
Removed support for the use of the != operator with multivalued attributes. Xpath equality expressions on multivalued attributes must use the not() function.</description>

      <description>AD RMS on Windows Server 2008 R2 adds a really slick feature blogged about here: Group Expansion for Federated Users
Prior to R2 to issue a use license to a federated user they need to specifically be granted permissions. With Windows Server 2008 R2 you can create a contact matching the external federated user and then place the contact in the group and then they have the same RMS permissions as that group.</description>

Very helpfull!! I was about to block sending emails to disabled accounts - not mailbox but accounts - so I can easily and quick retrieve some data from inactive inboxes. The solution is to create an empty group in AD and set the &amp;ldquo;dLMemSubmitPerms&amp;rdquo; parameter to accept messages only from that empty group! Amazing and great many thanks!</description>

      <description>Do you know what attributes are used to control who can and can&amp;rsquo;t send to a Distribution List in Exchange 2003 and Exchange 2007? or Does it use a DACL?
Knowing such things is key if you are going to automate distribution list management through .NET programs, or MIIS/ILM/FIM, Quest ARS or any other tool that is talking to LDAP attributes. For Powershell you need a separate list since the names are different.</description>

      <description>The Password Reset instructions ask us to use Group Policy to distribute the cert to the clients. This only works in Windows Server 2008 functional level domains. In Windows Server 2003 domains you can automate this using cerutil.exe
The following command will export the cert generated by ILM 2 install to the ilm2cert.cer file in the working directory
certutil -store trustedpeople IdentityLifeCycleManager2 ilm2cert.cer
This command can be used to import the cert from the command line</description>

      <description>If you will take a look at FIM(ILM) connections sc&amp;hellip; Unknown - Apr 2, 2009
If you will take a look at FIM(ILM) connections schema you will see that ILM MA has a direct SQL connectivity to FIM database (not through web service). As far as I know any change to metaverse schema fires up synchronization of this change to FIM database directly through SQL connection.</description>

      <description>Well I had a problem with a recent install &amp;ndash; the Metaverse Object Type Dropdown list was empty!
Turns out the source of this drop down list is the mv-data object type. However my install didn&amp;rsquo;t have this object. Obviously something was wrong. How does one create this object in the first place? Not directly in the portal. I am not certain when this object is supposed to be created. Install time?</description>

The dreaded Premature Failure during installation.
When I turned on logging for the install and examined the file, I found:

For obvious reasons the L was dropped when the F was added (Forefront + ILM = FILM).
So ILM 2 =&amp;gt; FIM 2010 (stole this graphic from Brad Turner&amp;rsquo;s blog &amp;ndash; his Smart Art creations are beautiful &amp;ndash; recently I have been studying smart art under his tutelage I hope to soon approach his level of skill)</description>
