      <description>From time to time I hear people wonder if MIM is dead.
Why do people ask?
They don&amp;rsquo;t feel like they have heard a good road map recently They aren&amp;rsquo;t seeing the improvements they hoped for They aren&amp;rsquo;t paying attention to the actions of the product group Why do I say it isn&amp;rsquo;t dead yet?
While the Cloud Identity is the future, we are and will be in hybrid identity for a long time and MIM is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s key component to that.</description>
