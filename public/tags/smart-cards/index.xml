      <description>Some days I am amazed at how deeply the identity management concepts have penetrated into popular culture:
&amp;ldquo;Mr Big Stuff, who do you think you are?&amp;rdquo; clearly relates to an authentication issue or authorization issue.
&amp;ldquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t get fooled again&amp;rdquo; by the WHO is clearly making a reference to a Certificate Revocation List, now that I have revoked your certificate you won&amp;rsquo;t be authenticated again.
One area where pop culture is still shockingly uninformed still need help is in asset protection.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday Bob Muglia made a big announcement &amp;ndash; ILM 2 Beta 3 has been released. While the beta install is only 64 bit on Microsoft Connect you can download the 32-bit Virtual PC. At the ILM 2 booth at Tech Ed the Microsoft ILM Product Group and I were handing them out like crazy.
Thanks to Nima for inviting me to participate at the booth.
Best session I went was by Candy Stark from MS IT.</description>
