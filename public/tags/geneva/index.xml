      <description>Back in business school I was a connoisseur of fine commercials.Â Recently I watched a commercial for Lipton Ice Tea (note I am a teetotaler who doesn&amp;rsquo;t drink tea) and I have to admire their cleverness in coming up with names for competitor products (see the title) in their &amp;ldquo;Lipton Tea, I think I love you&amp;rdquo; commercial. (Lyrics here)
Really the names are clever although the best is the H30 &amp;ndash; I just love it, a chemical compound that as far as I can tell can&amp;rsquo;t exist, but we all know they are making fun of flavored water.</description>

      <description>At the PDC Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Kim Cameron and colleague Bertocci Vittorio announced that Microsoft Live is now an Open Id provider. Additionally, when signing into Live you can use Information Cards (Info Card, Card Space, Geneva Card Space).
They also demonstrated the new Geneva Framework (formerly known as Zermat) &amp;ndash; essentially a successor to Windows Server 2008 Active Directory Federation Services, and showed it supporting SAML 2.0 the &amp;ldquo;protocol&amp;rdquo; not just SAML 2.</description>
