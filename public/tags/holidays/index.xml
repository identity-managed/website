      <description>&amp;lsquo;Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the internet
Not an identity was stirring, not even a Passport .NET
The user accounts requests were submitted with care
Hoping that their access would soon be there
The users were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of being able to do their jobs danced in their heads
The servers and computers were in sleep mode
Awaiting someone to move a mouse and send the wake up code</description>

      <description>233 years ago, 56 men signed a document and began a labor to give birth to a nation. I am very grateful for their service and for their sacrifices and for each and every soldier, and dutiful civil servant since then. They have afforded me and my family a great many blessings. As well some of my family members have been privileged to serve. One of my grandfathers taught ground school during World War II and the other served in the Army and was stationed in Greenland.</description>
