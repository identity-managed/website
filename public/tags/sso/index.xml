      <description>At last year&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Identity Summit in Vail I heard a lot about how the password is dead. I expect to hear a lot more this year.
Most of it fit into one of several categories:
Complaints about why passwords should be dead
In other words all of the various problems with passwords &amp;ndash; and there are
Schemes to have various applications depend on someone else&amp;rsquo;s password
While this is helpful it doesn&amp;rsquo;t kill the password</description>

      <description>The article on Password Sync for Office 365 is interesting news and clearly states that Federated users can&amp;rsquo;t have their password&amp;rsquo;s synced. In the Community Additions many curious users asked their questions treating it as a forum. Well here are my responses:
