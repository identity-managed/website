description: While support for Microsoft Identity Manager goes away in early
  2029 -- Many orgs continue to use MIM, especially for those with large
  on-premises investments that arenâ€™t going away any time soon. Used in
  conjunction with Entra ID and/or HyperSync and your solution can cover the
  Cloud and all your GRC needs. We continue to support these orgs helping them
  keep MIM healthy and planning their transition.
