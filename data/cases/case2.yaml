paragraph: "Empowered better and more secure collaboration between two divisions
  of this research company by implementing, Free/Busy Sharing, Cross Tenant Sync
  and a Custom Global Address list Synchronization, GalSync, to sync the groups,
  between two Entra ID Tenants (one in GCC High) coming from the same forest
  using the Entra ID Connect Sync instances for each tenant. This enabled both
  divisions to see the other divisionâ€™s users and mailing lists in their own
  address book, and thus send email more securely and easily. "
