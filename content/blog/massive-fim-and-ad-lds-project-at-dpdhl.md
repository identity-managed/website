[Watch the presentation that James Booth (who worked with us on the project) and Joe Gasowski (DPDHL)](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8503/65277) gave at the Redmond Identity Summit 2013 about our project at DHL to replace the DPDHL Sun One Directory and deploy FIM to replace both CriticalPath and a home-grown admin portal.
