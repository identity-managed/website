I had a lot of fun presenting this session. Largely based on chapter 5 in [volume 1](http://www.lulu.com/commerce/index.php?fBuyContent=9139861) I showed how to decide on your High availability approach, how that impacts your topology choice, and then how to estimate your scale, load, and complexity points. Then based on those factors figure out how big to make your SQL Server that hosts the FIM service database.

In the middle I did enjoy putting in a plug for our Ensynch sponsored green, dishwasher safe water bottles, as I took a drink of my fruit punch Gatorade mix.

I received lots of great questions and got to see lots of familiar faces.
