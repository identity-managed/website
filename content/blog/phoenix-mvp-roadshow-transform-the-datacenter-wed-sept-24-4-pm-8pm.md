[Register Now! to attend MVP Roadshow](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032595074&Culture=en-US&community=1) Sept 24th 4 PM - 8PM  
  
I will be presenting on why we want to get to Active Directory based on Windows Server 2012 R2 and how to get there. My fellow MVP's will be covering the rest of the agenda. I also created an IT clue game to play in small groups where the objective is to figure out who stole the data and how it could have been prevented.  
  
**Presented by:** [MVP David Lundell](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/David%20Lundell-40189), [MVP Jason Helmick](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/search-mvp.aspx?kw=jason+helmick), [MVP Rory Monaghan](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Rory%20Monaghan-5000266), [MVP Tom Ziegmann](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Tom%20Ziegmann-4030519)  
  

IT professionals face many challenges in their struggle to deliver the infrastructure, applications, and services that their organizations need.  Common issues include limited budgets, datacenter infrastructure complexity, and technical expertise to support a wide variety of changing goals.  New features in the Windows Server and Microsoft Azure platform can help address these problems by increasing resource utilization and by simplifying administration.

 This "Transform Your Datacenter MVP Roadshow" will focus on specific approaches, methods, and features that attendees can use to ultimately improve the services delivered to their users.  We'll begin by examining the issues that often prevent or delay infrastructure upgrades, and look at ways in which IT professionals can use modern approaches to overcome them.  Methods include leveraging cloud services where they make sense, and migrating from older OS's, such as Windows Server 2003.

 Next, we'll examine specific features in the Windows Server 2012 R2 platform that can help simplify and improve datacenter infrastructure.  Powerful features include updates such as iSCSI, SMB 3.0, Scale-Out File Server, data de-duplication, NIC teaming, and additional methods for improving your datacenter environment.  We'll also focus on virtualization features in the latest version of Hyper-V, including features for achieving low-cost high-availability, improved performance and scalability, and simplified administration. 

 Finally, we'll discuss ways in which you can take advantage of features in Windows Server 2012 R2 and services in Microsoft Azure to simplify and optimize your datacenter.  Topics include identifying the best candidate applications and services for moving to or integrating with the cloud, and methods of making these transformations.

 Overall, the focus will be on technical details and features that are available now to help IT pros optimize and transform their datacenter environments.  We hope you'll be able to join us!
