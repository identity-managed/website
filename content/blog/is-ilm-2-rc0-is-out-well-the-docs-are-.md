Most of the online Technet docs now read "ILM "2" (Release Candidate)"

For example check out the new ILM 2 Release Candidate Installation Guide

No more support for SQL 2005 from here on it is all SQL 2008

"SQL Server 2008 64-bit Standard or Enterprise Editions"

Good thing I just got back my score reports on my two SQL 2008 beta exams:

I am now an

[MCTS: SQL Server 2008, Implementation and Maintenance](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/sql/2008/)

and

[MCTS: SQL Server 2008, Business Intelligence Development and Maintenance](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/sql/2008/)

I guess that means I am qualified to keep working with ILM 2 ;)
