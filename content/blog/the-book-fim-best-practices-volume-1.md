In two weeks we (Brad Turner is my co-author) will make available for ordering a book on FIM entitled:

**FIM Best Practices Volume 1: Introduction, Architecture And Installation Of Forefront Identity Manager 2010**

Information on order will be posted here on my blog

This will be the first book on Forefront Identity Manager in English that is not focused on Certificate Management (Brian Komar wrote on book on FIM Certificate Management deployment and two gentlemen from Japan wrote a [book on FIM in Japanese](http://www.microsofttranslator.com/BV.aspx?ref=BVNav&from=&to=en&a=http%3A%2F%2Fidmlab.eidentity.jp%2F2010%2F06%2Factive-directory-id-fim2010.html) as blogged about by fellow MVP, [NaohiroÂ  Fujie](http://idmlab.eidentity.jp/).

Here is the Current Table of Contents:

Chapter 3: FIM Architecture

This gives a good understanding of FIM Architecture

Chapter 4: FIM Installation Topologies

Discusses how the various FIM components can be installed and discusses why to choose one topology over the other

Chapter 5: Sizing Your FIM Installation

This expands greatly upon the FIM Capacity Planning guide from Microsoft, helping you estimate your scale, load and complexity and then provides a methodology for sizing your FIM Servers and picking your topology. Includes flow charts to help you decide which components need to be highly available and which Edition of SQL Server to use.

Chapter 6: Installing the Prerequisites

Installing the Prerequisites is complex so we have created excellent flow charts to help you through it and include lots of discussion around decision points (like WSS stand-alone or farm).

Chapter 7: Installing FIM

Screen shot by screen shot we guide you through installing the FIM components. Also not to be missed our sections on unattended install where we match the UI install settings to the unattended ones and note where they are persisted (registry, databases, config files etc).

Chapter 8: Updating the FIM Components

FIM already has an update learn screen shot by screen shot where to go to get, prepare for it and install it.
