I recently joined the Identity Management Practice, as a Solution Architect, at [Ensynch](http://www.ensynch.com/) Inc, an [award winning](http://www.ensynch.com/PRItem.aspx?prID=70&year=2008) Microsoft Gold Partner based in Tempe, AZ, with a strong award winning presence in Southern California. In 2006 Ensynch won [Microsoft Worldwide Partner Award for Excellence in Active Directory and Identity Management](http://www.ensynch.com/PRItem.aspx?prID=46&year=2006) and in 2007 was the only finalist from North America. In fact the only finalist from the Western Hemisphere.  
  
I am especially happy to be working with [Brad Turner](http://www.identitychaos.com/), fellow ILM MVP and a good friend. I am also excited to work with the creator of the Camel Logic Configurator -- [Jerry Camel](http://digitalcamel.blogspot.com/).
