[Active Directory Federation Services v2 Ships!](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Identity/Active-Directory-Federation-Services-v2-Ships/ "Active Directory Federation Services v2 Ships!")

This is awesome stuff – with ADFS v2 we can help you setup SSO with your SaaS vendors.

Here is an example that has been rendered generic.

ADFS 2.0 supports SAML 2.0 (the idp lite profile and rdp lite profile) which opens up many federation doors and WIF allows us to write custom security token services (sts) just in case the idp lite and rdp lite profile support isn’t up to handling the interaction.
