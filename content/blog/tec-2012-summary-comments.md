Thanks David for a great overview of what was discussed at TEC this year. I wish I could have attended but way too much work right now but I hope I'll be able to attend TEC Europe this year (if there's gonna be any) and US next year.

Great to meet you David - thanks for the compliment ;) ... I'm one of those who's been using your SQL scripts for years, and it was great to rub shoulders with so many bright people in this relatively small niche of ours. Keep an eye on my blog for the tidbits that you missed for the Replay MA and Housekeeping ideas, and my latest post on something I'm passionate about!
