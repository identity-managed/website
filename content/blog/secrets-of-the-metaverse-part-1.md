Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2 SP1 (and its predecessors) can be classified as a MetaDirectory based Identity Management Solution. A MetaDirectory collects, aggregates, and stores data from various directories and data sources, such as Active Directory and your HR database.  
The Metaverse is the heart of FIM's MetaDirectory. As an implementer of FIM you customize the data model, you decide what object types and attributes you need.
