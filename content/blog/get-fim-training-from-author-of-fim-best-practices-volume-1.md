On Feb 8th - Feb 11th in downtown Phoenix (class will start at 8 AM), I will be teaching [50382A Implementing Forefront Identity Manager 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/course.aspx?ID=50382A) and of course adding in lots of valuable information from various FIM implementations that I have performed and supervised. Additionally, material from [FIM Best Practices Volume 1](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2010/08/book-is-here-fim-best-practices-volume.html) will be referenced during class (bring your copy to class). The cost of the course isÂ  $1895 USD.

This course is intended for Systems Engineers, Developers, Architects, and Project Leaders who need to gain a good understanding of how Forefront Identity Manager 2010 can be applied to manage identity information across a number of directories or databases. It is also suitable for those who simply want to review the technology in some depth.

After completing this course, students will be able to:

*   Understand FIM concepts and components.
*   Identify appropriate FIM scenarios.
*   Manage users, groups, and passwords using FIM.
*   Synchronize identity data across systems, such as Active Directory and HR.
*   Understand the issues involved in loading data (initial load, backup, and disaster recovery).
*   Configure security for different levels of user.
*   Manage password self-service reset and synchronization.
*   Automate run cycles.
*   Handle sets, simple workflows, and management policy rules (MPRs).
