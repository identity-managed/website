I went to Prague for a project intending to stay one week, but unfortunately I was delayed an additional week (volcanic ash cloud from Iceland – reread the news if you missed it). While Prague is a beautiful city and I met many wonderful people, the uncertainty of when I would be able to get home weighed heavily on me. I was worried about being separated from my family for weeks? months? More importantly ;) I was worried about getting back for The Experts Conference!

Well I have made good my escape! I am back home and will be heading to TEC! Hope to see you there!

BTW, Joe Zamora and I traded speaking slots (I was afraid I wasn’t going to arrive at TEC before Tuesday). No worries now, but we are keeping the schedule change. Joe will speak Monday after lunch and I will speak both Tue after lunch and then Wed at 8 AM.
