As most of you know I am regarded as one of the SQL gurus among the Microsoft Identity Management Gurus. For years, in my book and in speaking I have been recommending [Ola Hallengren's SQL Maintenance Solution](https://ola.hallengren.com/)Â to help take care of your ILM/FIM/MIM databases. But the SQL Maintenance Plan Wizard has come a long way. Tomorrow morning at 10 AM at Grand Canyon University I will be presenting as part of [SQL Saturday #726](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/726/Sessions/Schedule.aspx) a s[howdown between the SQL Maintenance Plan Wizard and Ola's solution](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/726/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=77361), discussing when you want to use one vs the other.
