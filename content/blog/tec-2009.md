Now that our pre-conference workshop on [Taming the Chaos – Building a Practical Lifecycle Mgt. Application in the ILM “2” Portal](http://www.tec2009.com/session_abstracts.php#wstaming) is done

and our (Brad, Chris and me) sessions  done: [Proper Care & Feeding of ILM, CLM and RMS](http://www.tec2009.com/session_abstracts.php#ridechaos) , [Designing an Object Expiration & Reconciliation process in ILM 2](http://www.tec2009.com/session_abstracts.php#designobjectilm2) , [Rescue Your Identity Metasystem from Chaos](http://www.tec2009.com/session_abstracts.php#rescue) (reporting against ILM 2), and [ADFS Extensibility](http://www.tec2009.com/session_abstracts.php#adfsextensibility), we are all able to relax a little and enjoy everyone else's sessions.

I spent a fair amount of time looking at Quest's One Identity Management Solutions (thanks to Jonathan Sanders), and I also got to attend Felix Gaehtgens's (Kuppinger Cole) session on [You've Authenticated the User, so Now What? wherein he discussed RBAC vs Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) and a standard that is new to me called XACML (Zack uh mel). I really enjoyed it despite it being a forward looking theoretical discussion.

Brad was telling me how much he enjoyed the [ILM “2” Chalktalk](http://www.tec2009.com/session_abstracts.php#ilm2chalktalk) by [Andreas Kjellman](http://www.tec2009.com/speaker_bios.php#kjellman) and [Mark Wahl](http://www.tec2009.com/speaker_bios.php#wahl)
