JefTek created a [niche hybrid tool](https://github.com/JefTek/MIMTools) that tackles a few pieces of the sync and service puzzle in a way that none of the others do.  
  
One noteable one for sync:  
Get and Export MIM Deltas to CSV (based on a drop file either stop and drop or the audit log dropped during the export  
  
It is great for setting up SharePoint and the Kerberos authentication to it.  
  
While it doesn't do all that [IS4U-FIM-PowerShell](https://github.com/wim-beck/IS4U-FIM-Powershell) (see my [review](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2017/03/open-source-review-of-is4u-fim.html)), does or [Lithnext resourcemanagement-powershell](https://github.com/lithnet/resourcemanagement-powershell) or [Lithnet-miis-powershell](https://github.com/lithnet/miis-powershell) ([see my review](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2017/03/open-source-review-of-lithnet.html)), or even the he  [FIM PowerShell Module](http://fimpowershellmodule.codeplex.com/) ([see my review](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2017/03/open-source-review-of-fim-powershell.html)), it fills a small niche that none of the rest of them do. This is a solid contribution!
