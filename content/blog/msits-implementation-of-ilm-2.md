TEC 2009 continues onto the last day.

Joel Silver spoke on his efforts and plans to implement ILM 2 for Microsoft. He presented a very interesting workflow to show how he addressed the challenge of creating unique email aliases.

Then I listened to [Felix](http://blogs.kuppingercole.com/gaehtgens/) as he discussed some of the interesting aspects of LDAP enhancements from around the vendorscape (I think I just made that word up).
