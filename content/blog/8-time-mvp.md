Today I received notification that for the 8th time (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) I have been honored by Microsoft as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP). According to the MVP web site there are currently 10 Identity Management MVP's in the world, and only three in North America.  
  
Looking forward to the on-going journey with this product set and wonderful friends I have made along the way, product group members (past and present), MVP's (past and present), readers (book, blog, twitter) and other Identity Management professionals.
