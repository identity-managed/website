'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the internet  
Not an identity was stirring, not even a Passport .NET  
The user accounts requests were submitted with care  
Hoping that their access would soon be there  
  
The users were nestled all snug in their beds  
While visions of being able to do their jobs danced in their heads  
The servers and computers were in sleep mode  
Awaiting someone to move a mouse and send the wake up code  
  
An urgent email pinging my iPhone created a vibration  
I sprang to my Surface to see what was the perturbation.  
Opening up Windows 8.1, I signed in to the computer  
I ran AD Users and Computers and Event Viewer  
  
User accounts had been created and added to groups  
All while I had slept after eating my soups  
As I looked at my network, what should appear?  
But a brand new Identity Management System so nice and clear  
  
On Sync Engine, on Management Agent! Now MPRs and Workflows!  
On Metaverse on Sync Rules! Â On PowerShell and Data flows!  
To the web service! To Self Service Password Resets!  
Provision, Deprovision and Synchronize all the sets!  
  
  
Ok, ok so maybe I am just a bit eager for the release of Microsoft Identity Manager (due out 1st half of 2015).
