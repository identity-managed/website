I will be attending Tech-Ed IT-Pro in a little over a week. My employer Ensynch has a booth. I will also be spending some time at the Microsoft ILM Product Group's booth.

  

  

  
Looking forward to seeing a bunch of folks out there and helping to demonstrate ILM 2 Beta 3! (Once it is released;)
