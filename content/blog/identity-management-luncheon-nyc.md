**Realizing the Value of Identity Management**

**Using Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager 2010 to Empower People, Deliver Agility and Efficiency, and Increase Security and Compliance of your Business**  
Ensynch and Microsoft invite you to join other senior technology and business executives at a **complementary exclusive luncheon** where we will discuss and demonstrate how Microsoft’s new identity management platform and solutions can help you consolidate technologies and reduce cost.

Today’s IT enterprise must deliver identity and access management that is efficient, cost effective, and secure. The complexity of managing and securing users, devices, and services is increasing. Whether due to regulatory mandate or business growth, identity management becomes more complex, and does often not deliver as much business benefit as it could.

Come and learn how Forefront Identity Manager 2010 can help you by delivering simplicity, agility and efficiency while increasing security and compliance within your enterprise identity infrastructure.  
**Event Agenda:**

Interactive demonstration and discussion of how Forefront Identity Manager 2010 helps to...  
• Ease Administrative Functions of Managing Identities  
• Enable Self Service Group Management  
• Increase Security and Compliance  
• Save Money – Realizing ROI  
• Empower collaboration by integrating with other cutting edge Microsoft technologies such as Office Communications Server and SharePoint.
