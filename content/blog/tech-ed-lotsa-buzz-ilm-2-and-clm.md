On Tuesday [Bob Muglia](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/bobmuglia/default.mspx) made a big announcement -- ILM 2 Beta 3 has been released. While the beta install is only 64 bit on Microsoft Connect you can download the 32-bit Virtual PC. At the ILM 2 booth at Tech Ed the Microsoft ILM Product Group and I were handing them out like crazy.  
  
Thanks to Nima for inviting me to participate at the booth.  
  
Best session I went was by Candy Stark from MS IT. She presented on the smart card deployment at MSFT using CLM.
