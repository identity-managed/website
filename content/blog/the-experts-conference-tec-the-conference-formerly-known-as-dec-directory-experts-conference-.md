Well the results are in! A good number of Ensynchians have been selected to speak at [The Experts Conference](http://www.tec2009.com/) March 22-25, 2009 just outside of Las Vegas, NV. This will be my third time speaking at this event. They renamed it TEC because Gil Kirkpatrick and Company at Netpro have expanded the event to include a conference on Exchange Server. All three of these sessions were highlighted in the [press release](http://www.tec2009.com/vegas/general_info/news/pr_announcement.php)
