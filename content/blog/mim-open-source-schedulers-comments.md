A friend have point out that my run script was mentioned in you blog.  
Have new version that I have used some time but not update on Github, have done so now.  
The new version have some nice more functions, so you may script disconnects and previews.  
  
I also recommend take look on [MIM-Powershell-Agent](https://github.com/aseand/MIM-Powershell-Agent), that is powershell agent and is passible run rules extensions as powershell script in MIM for any other.
