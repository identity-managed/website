[Carol](http://www.wapshere.com/missmiis) presented a solution to a very thorny problem – how to overcome the lack of delegation in BPOS. In BPOS a user is either an admin or a user. So she used FIM to provide the delegation. Very detailed, very complete solution. She illustrated some of the scripts she has posted on her blog such as [http://www.wapshere.com/missmiis/a-script-to-create-sets-and-mprs-from-templates](http://www.wapshere.com/missmiis/a-script-to-create-sets-and-mprs-from-templates "http://www.wapshere.com/missmiis/a-script-to-create-sets-and-mprs-from-templates") 

Well done Carol!
