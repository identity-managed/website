Soon I will be adding the 2018-2019 ring onto this trophy. This makes 12 times starting back in 2007.  
  
The MVP program means a lot to me. So I have written a book about MVPs in both tech and sports. It will be coming out soon. I could use [your help with the title](https://www.facebook.com/1587066757/posts/10211450777736915/).  
  
Thanks,
