My colleague Joe Zamora, a talented developer, who has been instrumental in helping us advance our knowledge of custom workflows, has just launched his own blog: [CShark](http://c--shark.blogspot.com:80/).

His first post is on how to "[Generate AccountName in ILM2 custom workflow activity](http://c--shark.blogspot.com/2009/02/generate-accountname-in-ilm-2-custom.html)" and it came in response to a question in the ILM 2 connect forum entitled:Â  Custom Workflow Activity to Generate samAccountName.

Go Joe Go!
