A few days after my post about setting up the ILM 2 Web Service reference Joe Schulman and others from the ILM product group began a [new blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/imex/archive/2008/11/04/introduction-to-this-blog.aspx) designed to fill in the gaps in the knowledge in the community about how to use the web services. So far the blog looks great and is a welcome addition to my knowledge and the communities knowledge base! Great job Joe and Company and thanks for the link to my blog.

**[Identity Management Extensibility](http://blogs.msdn.com/imex/default.aspx)**

I recommend starting out by reading the [intro post](http://blogs.msdn.com/imex/archive/2008/11/04/introduction-to-this-blog.aspx) as it gives a great overview of what to expect.

Also check out the [code samples online at MSDN](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/imexsamples)

Shortly I will be getting back to more technical posts.
