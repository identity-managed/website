[Laura Hunter](http://www.shutuplaura.com/journal/2008/8/16/if-you-get-the-joke-you-will-be-joining-me-in-laughing-until.html) is perpetuating a prank that according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickroll) has reached such mainstream acceptance that Youtube pranked all of its visitors on April 1st of this year.

Only Laura has pulled off this prank with such utter geekiness!
