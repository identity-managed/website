Last week I taught a group of students [50382A Implementing Forefront Identity Manager 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/course.aspx?ID=50382A), and referenced [FIM Best Practices Volume 1](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2010/08/book-is-here-fim-best-practices-volume.html) to supplement. It was a great bunch, full of humor. We even had one gentleman fly all the way from Australia to attend my class. I felt quite honored.

Well due to popular demand we are going to run it again May 23-May 26 (M-Th) once more in downtown Phoenix.

Register by emailing [FIMTraining@Ensynch.com](mailto:FIMTraining@Ensynch.com?subject=FIM%20Training%2050382A%20Feb%208%202011), providing your contact info, which class and date you want to attend. You will then be contacted to complete the registration. The cost of the course is  $1895 USD

The courseware is very good with quite solid labs. The first lab provides a great overview experience of FIM, much like the first lab of ILM 2 Beta pre-conference workshop I did at DEC 2008 in Chicago, only even sweeter and focused just on FIM. Then in lab 2 you start of with a fresh environment and build the solution from there, setting up Management Agents and configuring Join/Projection rules, Attribute flow rules and learning about the sync engine. Module 3 commences with delving deeper into the Sync Engine. I showed the [ILM 2 (FIM) Flow Chart with Screen shots and code snippets](http://www.ensynch.com/Documents.aspx?docID=138) that Brad and I did in 2009. Then with Module 4 we start into managing users through the FIM Portal and then into Management Policy Rules and Sets (here I diverted to cover some more graphical slides around MPRs and Sets). Module 5 covers inbound synch rules and outbound sync rules showing how to replace the classic rules with declarative rules from the portal. With Module 6 we dived into the management of credentials – password sync and password reset. In Module 7 we run through group management and in 8 we covered many other items including automating the Sync Engine.

This course is intended for Systems Engineers, Developers, Architects, and Project Leaders who need to gain a good understanding of how Forefront Identity Manager 2010 can be applied to manage identity information across a number of directories or databases. It is also suitable for those who simply want to review the technology in some depth.

After completing this course, students will be able to:

*   Understand FIM concepts and components.
*   Identify appropriate FIM scenarios.
*   Manage users, groups, and passwords using FIM.
*   Synchronize identity data across systems, such as Active Directory and HR.
*   Understand the issues involved in loading data (initial load, backup, and disaster recovery).
*   Configure security for different levels of user.
*   Manage password self-service reset and synchronization.
*   Automate run cycles.
*   Handle sets, simple workflows, and management policy rules (MPRs).
