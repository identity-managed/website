I will be speaking at the 2015 Redmond Summit: Where Identity Meets Enterprise Mobility.  
This summit is put on by my friends at Oxford Computer Group.  
  
I will be speaking on Password Sync vs.  ADFS. Then the next day I will speak on the Business track about How Identity Management Impacts the Bottom Line.
