Well I had a problem with a recent install -- the Metaverse Object Type Dropdown list was empty!

Turns out the source of this drop down list is the mv-data object type. However my install didn't have this object. Obviously something was wrong. How does one create this object in the first place? Not directly in the portal. I am not certain when this object is supposed to be created. Install time? First export through the ILM MA? None of these seem to match up based on time stamps. It wasn't created during install. It was created before the first import of the ILM MA, and the first Export of the ILM MA. It does match the time of the creation of the ILM MA in the Identity Manager tool in the synchronization engine.Â  The object is created by a request generated by the [Built In Synchronization Account (BISA)](http://www.identitychaos.com/2008/08/ilm-2-beta-3-built-in-synchronization.html) this is the account used by the ILM MA.

My solution was to modify my ILM sync engine Metaverse schema and then viola the drop down list was populated (the mv-data object was created). This means that after the MA is created some process in the sync engine is either sending a request to the ILM 2 Web Service through the ILM MA or the ILM 2 web service is monitoring the Sync Engine. I am guessing the former.
