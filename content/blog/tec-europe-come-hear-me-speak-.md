Speaker:** [David Lundell](http://www.theexpertsconference.com/agenda-speakers/directory-identity-training/speaker-bios/#lundell)

Learn how to tune FIM 2010 to make it scream. Take a look at the various architectures and what they buy you. Learn how crucial SQL is to FIM performance and what to do about it. You’ll also learn tips for workflows and the FIM web service and receive a crash course in the SQL Server Optimization.

**Proper Care and Feeding of Your Databases: FIM, ILM, CLM, RMS, SharePoint and OCS  
****Speaker:** [David Lundell](http://www.theexpertsconference.com/agenda-speakers/directory-identity-training/speaker-bios/#lundell)

Without proper care and feeding of your databases (FIM Meta Directory Services, FIM Certificate Services, FIM Web Service, RMS, SharePoint and OCS logging), chaos will result. Learn to conquer the chaos as David Lundell, SQL expert and ILM/FIM MVP, teaches you appropriate backup strategies, database and index maintenance tactics, and performance optimization tricks including guidance on fillfactor settings for SharePoint. You will also receive a crash course in the SQL Transaction Log, SQL Recovery Models, Database Maintenance Plans, Index Optimization, SQL Backups, and SQL Agent Jobs.
