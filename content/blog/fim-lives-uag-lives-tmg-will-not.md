Today [Microsoft announced the discontinuing or subsuming of many products in the Forefront line](http://blogs.technet.com/b/server-cloud/archive/2012/09/12/important-changes-to-forefront-product-roadmaps.aspx) 

To be crystal clear Forefront Identity Manager (FIM) and Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG) live on as separate products with ongoing investment!

Insert the obligatory Mark Twain quote here. “The rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated”

Product

Fate

Forefront Protection for Office Communication Server (FSOCS)

SharePoint and Lync Servers will continue to offer the built-in security capabilities that many customers use to protect shared documents

I think it is safe to say that we are seeing the Forefront brand being disbanded.

I wonder what new names they will come up with for Forefront Identity Manager and Forefront Unified Access Gateway. I guess we will have to wait and see which family of products adopts them.
