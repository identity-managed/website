Here is what the text on page 183 should say (the italicized items are the new or changed bits of text)

##### Unattended Install of the FIM Client

This is the component that you will perhaps most desperately see the need for unattended install.

Use the following table to help you plan your install as well as to understand the relationship between the UI parameters, the Unattended parameters and where these items are persisted. _These items can also be controlled through Group Policy templates that are shipped with the product._

These items are persisted in one of four spots in the registry:

_HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Forefront Identity Manager\\2010\\_

_Add-ins_

_Extensions_

_Extensions\\Intranet_
