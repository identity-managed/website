I will speak at [Kuppinger Cole's European Identity Conference](https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2018) on [Top 10 Lessons from Disasters in Identity Management](http://top%2010%20lessons%20from%20disasters%20in%20identity%20management/) in May in Munich.  
  
With great automation capability comes great responsibility! Come discuss and learn vital lessons gleaned from disasters in Identity Management.  
  
So if you would like your disaster story to be considered for inclusion let me know. I would love to add to the stories.  
  
This will be a fun interactive session.
