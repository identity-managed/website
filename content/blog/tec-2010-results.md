TEC 2010 was a blast. In the Kickoff Gil Kirkpatrick issued several challenges including one to Brad Turner to simulate the workings of the FIM Sync Engine. Eventually we expect to see a video of the final presentation posted to YouTube. In the interim Brad has some nice pictures posted: [TEC 2010 – Annual Wook Lee Memorial Challenge for Identity Results](http://www.identitychaos.com/2010/04/tec-2010-annual-wook-lee-memorial_29.html "TEC 2010 – Annual Wook Lee Memorial Challenge for Identity Results")

I attended Craig Martin’s session “Automate FIM deployment with Powershell” and learned a few things about the [FIM Powershell commandlets](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff394179.aspx).

Next I split my time between Joe Zamora’s session on Custom Workflow in FIM 2010 and Gil and Jeremy’s session on Reporting in FIM 2010. (I had swapped my session time on Monday with Joe’s Wednesday time as I was worried that the Icelandic Volcanic Ash cloud was going to keep me from getting there on Monday – but it didn’t). I enjoyed both. I am afraid my late arrival in Gil and Jeremy’s session caused a bit of a stir as they were discussing some of their SQLXML tricks and Jeremy told everyone that wanted to know more about it to ask me (as I am looking at their stuff for the first time).  I think Gil and Jeremy had a great presentation with a fascinating proof of concept. I heartily endorse their statements regarding this not being a production ready setup but I love what they showed.

Other concerns caused me to miss the rest of the afternoon. The Quest Hospitality Suite was nice.

Tuesday morning I put the finishing touches on my presentations and then attended Jack Kabat’s session on Deploying FIM, he provided some good advice on how to handle the initial load scenario.

After lunch I presented on Care and Feeding of Databases. I had quite a wide range of attendees. Some were interested in the SharePoint databases others in OCS and of course the majority for FIM Service and Sync. There were also a few who needed to know about FIM CM. I did also show a few photos from my recent trip to Prague including my evidence of elven habitation (they had their own check in kiosk at the Prague Airport).

That night we (Ensynch) had a great party at the ESPN Zone watching the Lakers eliminate the Oklahoma City Thunder. We rented out the Championship Lounge which is above the rest of the facility and feels like a skybox, including big windows out which you can see the big screen at the Bar. We were 100 yards away from the Staples center so after the game we had to fend off some game attendees intent on crashing our party.

Wednesday morning I presented on FIM Performance tuning and talked about the performance improvements that are possible. Then Brad spoke about using ROPU (Run On Policy Update, which we pronounce Rope You, because it ropes you into doing more things) and its power.
