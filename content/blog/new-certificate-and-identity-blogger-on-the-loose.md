Marc Mac Donnell has just launched his blog on [http://assurancesinidentity.blogspot.com/](http://assurancesinidentity.blogspot.com/ "http://assurancesinidentity.blogspot.com/") and called it Assurances in Identity, and has posted the links to the CLM API documentation and [case study](http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=4000003478) about some work he did with MCS UK and CapGemini.

I look forward to many more posts from Mark about some of the wizardry and trick in managing certificates and identities.
