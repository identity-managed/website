In the last four months two very talented people have joined Ensynch, Chris Calderon, ILM MVP, and Mark Struck.

Chris Calderon of [IdentityJunkie.com](http://blog.identityjunkie.com) fame is extremely talented with ILM, AD Federated Services (AD FS) and many other tools.

Mark Struck, is a very talented developer, and experienced implementer of ILM. Even before Mark joined the team he and I collaborated to figure out how to use the ILM 2 web services.
