Last night as I took my children trick or treating through our neighborhood I thought about Halloween from an Identity Management Perspective:

We provision temporary identities to our children (costumes) that allow them to make a claim when they show up at neighbors' doors "Trick or Treat (I am wearing costume -- the claim; will your grant me access to candy -- the resource request)?"

At which point the neighbor will almost invariably give out some candy.

But try showing up without a costume! Most have their permissions set up so that you can't get candy without a valid claim.

Then we as parent's provide a virus scanner -- looking over the candy to ensure that it is safe.

I am still trying to figure out how the pumpkins and Jack O'Lanterns fit into the metaphor. Happy Halloween!
