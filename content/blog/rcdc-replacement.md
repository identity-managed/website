**FIM User Interface Implementation: Replace the rigid RCDC with a customizable UI  
Speaker:** [Eihab Isaac](http://www.theexpertsconference.com/us/2012/directory-identity/speaker-bios/#eisaac)

Eihab delivered a very well-reasoned presentation on the pros and cons of replacing some of the forms, especially the create person (user) form. Excellent demo showing creating multiple requests for creating the user as well as requests for additional attributes, and application access. Great session.
