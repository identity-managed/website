In 2017 and the beginning of 2018 I have had some rough times. The Long and the Short of it is that late last year my mother passed away in the hospital. Then early this year, my father died, probably of a broken heart.  
  
Thanks to many friends from church, our neighborhood, professionally, other Microsoft MVP's, I have had a lot of support while mourning their temporary absence from my life. Especially, thanks to my wife, kids, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins.  
  
Last Saturday, one of my sisters was married, it was a beautiful but slightly sad moment for our family.  
  
I am feeling a return to my usual high energy levels and am resuming blogging to help you, my friends, avoid the pains that I have endured and that I have seen others endure as we labor to implement Identity Management across the world.  
  
I am also excited about some other projects that I will soon announce here and through other venues.  
  
Well back to blogging about the technical stuff!
