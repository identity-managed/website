I was pleasantly surprised today to find three other books, referencing FIM Best Practices Volume 1, which because of a Lulu Sale you can get at 25% off until 12/14/2011 **Coupon Code: BUYMYBOOK305 Coupon expires December 14, 2011 $50 Max Savings. Of course today only 30% off, CYBERMONDAY305.**

All three have an identical blurb about FIM and reference FIM Best Practices Volume 1 as additional material.

Although the blurb lists the license for FIM as Shareware. I hadn’t thought that FIM would fit the definition of Shareware.

All three appear to start with an introductory paper, and the contain a compilation of articles on various related technologies.
