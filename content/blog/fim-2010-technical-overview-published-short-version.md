Microsoft has published a short version of the [FIM Technical Overview whitepaper](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff621362(WS.10).aspx) written by David Lundell (me), [Brad Turner](http://www.identitychaos.com), [Chris Calderon](http://blog.identityjunkie.com/) and [Joe Zamora](http://c--shark.blogspot.com/). The longer version will come out a bit later. Short version, long version makes me feel kind of like I am figure skating in the Olympics. Thank you to Brjann Brekkan, Mark Wahl, Joe Schulman, Darryl Russi, Jack Kabat and Andreas Kjellman for their support, editing, eluciations on blogs and encouragement on this paper.

Microsoft has also released the [updated FIM documentation for RTM](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff602041(WS.10).aspx). Congrats to Dave Kreitler, Markus, Brad Benefield and the rest of the documentation team!

I love the [capacity planning guide section](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=185246) as well as the section [Expected State Detection](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff608269(WS.10).aspx) (formerly Object State Detection, and also referred to as Existence Test, Detected Rules Entry, Detected Rules List).

Fellow FIM Bots, Fellow FIMers, Fellow FIMians, Fellow FIMsters! Enjoy!
