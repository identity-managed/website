Just because we didn't participate in Earth Hour, didn't mean that our Power company, Salt River Project (SRP) needed to turn off power to the whole neighborhood last night and again this morning ;)

I am all for using our resources wisely. But sometimes I rebel against the symbolic gestures.

I mean if the power company needs an hour off can't they just schedule downtime like we do with computer systems?
