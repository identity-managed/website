Wow TEC 2012 is already over and I am already back home. What a week!

The venue was great. San Diego is always a great place to be, cool yet not too cold. Right on the bay. Great hotel. The Marriot Marquis and Marinas has an awesome pool – went for a great swim on Monday night. Tuesday morning I really enjoyed a jog on the Boardwalk. I ran up to the USS Midway. Tons of other attractions right nearby.

The sessions were very good. Unfortunately, I couldn’t attend all of the sessions I wanted to attend. I had a few conference calls and sometimes they were at the same time.

The keynote by Uday Hegde was quite good – he covered how Windows 8 (Windows Server 2012) will extend the File Classification Infrastructure type technology to permissions. We will be able to do claims based permissions on files! Pretty cool. Deployment of AD will become simpler – less running around to different machines to run prep this and prep that.

I skipped Adam and Ken’s session on Reporting with FIM R2. I am sure it was excellent and very similar to what they showed us at MVP summit (that and a con call meant I wasn’t there). I also had to pass on Jeremy’s session on SCIM, which was also at the same hour as Laura Hunter’s session on Protection at MSFT.

In the afternoon I conducted the showdown between Classic and Declarative and had a great time, but was wishing I could have split in two and attended Brian Desmond’s session on Office 365 prep to see if he has come up with a different way to solve the issues.

I then yielded the stage to Carol Wapshere for the Sync Service migration toolkit – looking forward to those scripts.

Then a con call interrupted my attendance.

The Meet the experts was fun, I got to meet a lot of folks that came over to get a copy of the book signed. Signing books is still a bit of a surreal experience (today we gave Anil Desai a ride to the airport – he wrote one of the first Windows books I read).

The Party was on the terrace and it was a bit breezy but quite fun with pool tables and a woman wearing dress with a table, yes a table. Bob Bobel of Quest told me that she was a party crasher. Well she certainly was a conversation piece.

Tuesday morning I caught Craig Martin’s session on PowerShell and SSRS to do reporting from FIM. It is brilliant work, however Craig keeps insisting on calling SSRS, scissors! I keep telling him to not to run (PowerShell) with Scissors (SSRS) ![Winking smile](http://www.ilmbestpractices.com/blog/uploaded_images/Lutz-schools-us-on-Cloud-and-Deci_C2CF/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png)

After lunch I saw Lutz deliver his session on BYOD and the cloud. Then we prepped for his Wed sessions.

Lutz attended several of the RMS related sessions and said they were very sparsely attended.

Tuesday night I attended the reception for a brief bit and then slipped out to dinner with a relative that lives nearby.

Wednesday, I was about to slip into Bob Bradley’s session on self-healing FIM, when I saw him sit down to breakfast. So after discovering that his session got changed to 9:45 he and I got to talking. That’s a fellow with head full of bright ideas.

Then I attended Lutz’s session on PKI housekeeping. Good job Lutz! I gave him a slide promoting the book, and he told his audience that he was leveraging that for an upgrade to business class on his next flight ![Winking smile](http://www.ilmbestpractices.com/blog/uploaded_images/Lutz-schools-us-on-Cloud-and-Deci_C2CF/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png)

Man I was hoping to see Eric Huebner’s session on manipulating data in FIM. Similar to the showdown but come at it from a very different angle, instead of arguing which is better, he discussed some of the performance considerations of one vs. the other and I understand that he even discussed “Request Splitting” in FIM 2010 R2 – allows you to have child requests that do go through the full pipeline and are subject to approval requests!

Then I went to Ehaib Isaac’s session – already blogged a lot about that one. One more mention. Ehaib mentioned he is working on his master’s degree but then showed us a slide of Jobs, Gates, and other billionaire college dropouts. In general more education is correlated with higher pay, although there a few exceptions. Great job!

The lunch on Wednesday had a great dessert! Fortunately I resisted the temptation to have seconds. Phew!

Two people at my lunch table won in the drawing. It was cool to be near two such lucky people!
