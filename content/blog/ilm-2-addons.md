Marvin Tansley of Gemalto demonstrated their add-on to ILM 2 for provisioning One Time Password (OTP) devices using ILM 2, with the goal of minimizing the # of portals that users visit in order to perform self service management. It looks really good, it even accounts for lost device management.

Gil Kirkpatrick of Quest interviewed me on camera to discuss my experiences at the conference. That was fun.

At lunch Gil handed out prizes (we provided a red colored XBox -- I guess the red had something to do with Resident Evil). But you had to present to win, and I do mean present -- you had to respond within 10 seconds to get your prize.
