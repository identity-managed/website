I have attended at spoke at this conference since 2007. I love it. It is a great experience and loads of great in-depth technical training by top experts on Directory & Identity, as well as SharePoint, Exchange, Virtualization & Cloud and PowerShell Deep Dive. Also come and learn about the inside joke dealing with the rubber chicken.
