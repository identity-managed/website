I conducted a [linkedIn poll](http://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers=&discussionID=205602647&gid=1714607&trk=eml-anet_dig-b_nd-pst_ttle-cn&ut=2lbE2Ag1j_KRA1) to find out what others thought of the [features that are deprecated](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj879229(v=ws.10).aspx) starting in FIM 2010 R2 SP1. For the poll I only listed the ones I put in my [top 5 list](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2013/01/top-5-deprecated-features-as-of-fim.html). With 15 votes and 1 abstention I thought it would be worthwhile to publish the results:

Here we can see the winner:

1.  Multi-mastery/equal precedence (I had this 2nd)
2.  ECMA1 (XMA) (I had this third)
3.  Tie: Combined Run Profile Steps (e.g. DI/DS)Â  (this was my vote)

1.  Tie:Transaction properties (I had this 4th)

5.  FIM CM MA and CLM utils (I had this last)

If the results change significantly over the next two weeks I will post again.
