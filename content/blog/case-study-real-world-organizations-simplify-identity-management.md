Tomorrow morning at 8 AM PST I will be participating as a speaker in a [webinar](http://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/22703) with Jonathan Sander from Quest.

[http://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/22703](http://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/22703 "http://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/22703") 

Successful identity and access management means different things to different organizations, but in almost every case, it requires complex, time-consuming, and expensive solutions. However, an ever-growing number of organizations have found a new way to achieve their identity and access management objectives simply, inexpensively, and powerfully.

In this webcast, identity and access management experts will discuss how organizations like yours have discovered and are implementing a simplified approach to identity and access management.

**WHEN:**  Live Tomorrow, November 12, 8am PDT / 11am EDT, or after on demand

**TOPICS COVERED:**

*   Consolidating identities and directories
*   Automating processes
*   Unifying roles, policy, workflow, and attestation
