[Insight to acquire Ensynch.](https://www.insight.com/us/en/12760.html)  
As my colleague [Rebecca Croft said](http://www.apollojack.com/2011/09/ensynch-joins-insight.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ApolloJack+%28Apollo+Jack%29):  
We are very excited about the union of Insight and Ensynch and the benefits that it will bring to our clients. Both companies are focused on helping our clients find innovative, cost effective solutions to address business needs. Bringing Ensynch into the Insight organization will offer clients more robust software services, particularly around Microsoft Enterprise Agreements, as well as improved services delivery, enhanced virtualization and cloud capabilities and solution-focused approach to software sales. This acquisition will further simplify our clients’ ability to acquire, procure, implement and manage IT solutions across their technology environment.
