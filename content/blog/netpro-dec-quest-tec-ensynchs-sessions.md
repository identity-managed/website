Back in business school we always studied name changes and rebranding, and this one has been interesting

Last summer NetPro deciding to expand the Directory Experts Conference (DEC) to include an exchange conference and so they re-branded the conference NetPro's The Experts Conference. Then Quest acquired NetPro, so it became a completely re-branded conference as Quest's The Expert Conference. 

So NetPro DEC became Quest TEC.
