So I went to install SQL 2016 on a server (been using it for a while, I get vm's on CloudShare where SQL is preinstallled, so first time installing it for myself) -- no problem. Hey, where is SQL Management Studio (SSMS)? Well it isn't include in the 2.6Â  GB SQL Server ISO. You have to download it separately. 800 MB. All I can say is You're Welcome!  
  
I get why they did it -- they can update SSMS much more often etc.But what a surprise.
