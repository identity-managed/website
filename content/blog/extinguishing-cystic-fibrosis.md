Well, we are on our way towards our goal of $2000, but we need more help (please [make a donation](http://azstairclimb.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=429516&lis=1&kntae429516=8A9E846281D84357B19B34FDF5DDFFCA&supId=0&team=3867503&cj=)).

Refresher:

Every year Ensynch sponsor’s the Ensynch Stairclimb and Firefighter challenge. The purpose of the event is to raise money for research on Cystic Fibrosis. The [event is this Saturday](http://azstairclimb.kintera.org/faf/help/helpEventInfo.asp?ievent=429516), in Phoenix at Arizona Center - 5th Street & Van Buren.  This year I am heading up the Stripes team, we have a goal of raising $2000 by this Saturday. Many of our team mates at Ensynch will be climbing stairs. If you live in Phoenix or will be here this Saturday you can [participate too](https://www.kintera.org/faf/reg_new/register.asp?ievent=429516&lis=1&kntae429516=8A9E846281D84357B19B34FDF5DDFFCA&jt=3867503&teamsName=Ensynch+PS+Stripes) (you can climb or come and cheer as part of the no-sweat supporters). Alternatively, you can sponsor one, [make a donation](http://azstairclimb.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=429516&lis=1&kntae429516=8A9E846281D84357B19B34FDF5DDFFCA&supId=0&team=3867503&cj=) in our team’s name. The event also includes cheering on different firefighting teams as they perform their challenges!

Last year there was food and various family friendly activities. My kids had a blast!
