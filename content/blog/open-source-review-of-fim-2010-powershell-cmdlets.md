[Gil Kirkpatrick](http://gilkirkpatrick.com/Blog/) (a great guy, fellow MVP, who has taught me a lot over the years) created one of the very first, if not the first, P[owerShell commandlets libraries to manage FIM/MIM service](http://fimpscmdlets.codeplex.com/). It hasn't had any activity in years, but it served as a great example to get others going.  
  
If you like this simple approach you could check out Adam Weigert's PowerShell for FIM 2010 (see [my review](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2017/03/open-source-review-of-powershell-for.html)).  
  
I recommend  [IS4U-FIM-PowerShell](https://github.com/wim-beck/IS4U-FIM-Powershell) (see my [review](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2017/03/open-source-review-of-is4u-fim.html)), this is what I use. But I also recommend  [Lithnext resourcemanagement-powershell](https://github.com/lithnet/resourcemanagement-powershell) ([see my review](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2017/03/open-source-review-of-lithnet.html)).
