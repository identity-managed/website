In the 1980's Steve Miller and Clifford Neuman published a new security protocol, called [Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)), after the mythical three headed dog that guards the gates of Hades.  
  
In 2014 the [alliance published the FIDO standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO_Alliance). This exciting standard is enabling a passwordless world (yet to come). For example you can use a small USB device with a key on it to login instead of entering a password. FIDO 2.0 is requiring two-factor, type in a PIN plus your key. Other options exist as well potentially using Smart Phones, or other devices via USB, Bluetooth or NFC.  
  
What's next more dog name related authentication schemes?  
  
Goofy Authentication -- something likeÂ [Dance Dance Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgC4b9K-gYU).  
  
Snoopy Authentication -- you have to fight the Red Baron first.  
  
Scooby Doo -- Solve a mystery in order to log in?  
  
Lassie -- Requires saving Timmy first.  
  
Pluto/Belka -- Must point your telescope at the Star you had named in the star registry.  
  
Spike -- Biometric -- blood sample required.  
  
Marmaduke -- this could work well with kids -- you have to make a mess that is uniquely you!
