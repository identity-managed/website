Once more we invite you to another Ensynch Identity Management webinar. This is part 2 in our series of 4 on Geneva (ADFS, WIF). This one is going to be led by [Chris Calderon](http://blog.identityjunkie.com/) one of our ADFS Experts, so naturally this will be filled with excellent technical content. As will Part 3 as it focuses on Windows Identity Foundation.
