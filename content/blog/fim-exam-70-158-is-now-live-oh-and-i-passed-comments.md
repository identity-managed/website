Congrats!  
  
This is interesting area -and product but suffers from availability of learning materials..  
  
Like i couldn't find practice tests at all. And im used to study with those MS presss books and their companion CD's with practice tests.  
Sure i do labs in virtual environments too but for me those practice tests give that last confidence that i need to book exam. :)
