On the eve of Thanksgiving I offer 5 reasons to be thankful for Identity Management (user provisioning, deprovisioning, group and role management, etc.):

1.  What other compliance project can actually have a positive ROI?
    1.  You get improved compliance (and the ability to show it)
    2.  You also get better security as accounts are disabled quickly
    3.  Then you save money through the automation
2.  Identity Management can help support your corporate goals
3.  You can empower users to serve themselves with password resets, group/role requests
4.  It can help keep your organization out of the shame columns in the trade rags
    1.  We have all read about the disgruntled former employee accessing data.
5.  The joy of automation, the joy of not having to do double data entry!
