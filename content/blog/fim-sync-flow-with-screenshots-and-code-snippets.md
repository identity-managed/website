Years ago Brad Turner and I created a [Flow Chart of FIM data flow with Screenshots and Code snippets](http://www.ilmbestpractices.com/files/FIM_Sync_Flow_with_Screenshots.pdf). Some of the code examples are funny and it still says ILM rather than FIM. It also doesn't include filter based out bound filter-based sync rules that came with R2. Bearing those things in mind it still provides a good bit of value. Someday I will update it with the latest -- until then enjoy.
