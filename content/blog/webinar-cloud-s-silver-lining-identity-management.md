Identity Management is a critical component to realizing the true value of the Cloud.

Solutions from Microsoft including Forefront Identity Manager (FIM), Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), and Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway (Forefront UAG) allow you to get the most out of your cloud applications (such as Office 365, BPOS, and other Software a Service (SaaS) solutions); while enabling a seamless transition in managing the identities of your users.

If you are planning to migrate or deploy applications to the Cloud, you must first address provisioning and Single Sign-On (SSO)in order to enable a seamless transition.

Delivered by Microsoft FIM MVP David Lundell, this webcast will provide insight on how to save money and make your business more agile with the Cloud, by ensuring you have a successful Identity Management strategy.
