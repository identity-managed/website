Some days I am amazed at how deeply the identity management concepts have penetrated into popular culture:

"Mr Big Stuff, who do you think you are?" clearly relates to an authentication issue or authorization issue.

"Won't get fooled again" by the WHO is clearly making a reference to a Certificate Revocation List, now that I have revoked your certificate you won't be authenticated again.

One area where pop culture is still shockingly uninformed still need help is in asset protection. I guess the authors of many forlorn love songs wish they could have used Rights Management Service and issued a use license that did not contain the permission to "Steal my heart" and "Break my heart."
