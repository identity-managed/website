233 years ago, 56 men signed a document and began a labor to give birth to a nation. I am very grateful for their service and for their sacrifices and for each and every soldier, and dutiful civil servant since then. They have afforded me and my family a great many blessings. As well some of my family members have been privileged to serve. One of my grandfathers taught ground school during World War II and the other served in the Army and was stationed in Greenland. I honor their service.

As part of my Independence Day celebration I read some of the writings of Abraham Lincoln. I found this moving passage from his first public speech in March 9, 1832 to the people of Sangamon County, he spoke on the topic of education :

"That every man may receive at least a moderate education, and thereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries, by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions, appears to be an object of vital importance, even on this account alone, to say nothing of the advantages and satisfactionÂ  to be derived from all being to read the Scriptures and other works, both of a religious and moral nature themselves."

I believe that this "moderate education" unto "every man" is a key basis for our continuing freedom.

I also wonder whether Identity Management would have a much different meaning without the Declaration of Independence.
