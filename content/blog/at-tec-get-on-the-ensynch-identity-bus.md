If you are coming to [TEC 2009](http://www.tec2009.com/) at the Green Valley Ranch Resort outside of Las Vegas, and want to take a trip to the strip Monday or Tuesday night then you are in luck -- Ensynch is sponsoring the Identity Bus -- we'll have some buses that will be running from the Resort to one of the Monorail stops on the strip. Details will be provided at the conference in your handouts. I will riding on the Identity Bus some of the time and hope to see you there!

Thanks to Stuart Kwan for coining the term Identity Bus, and thanks to Christine McDermott for helping suggest a practical way to make it happen, and thanks to Tyeson Cluff our marketing consultant for making it happen!
