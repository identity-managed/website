Early last week I sent the book out for review. I have been digesting the excellent feedback I have gotten (thanks to Peter Geelen, Paul Loonen, Andreas Kjellman, and Glenn Zuckerman). Apparently, they liked Brad’s architecture diagrams more than mine (so do I) so I need to update the other architecture diagrams to be like his. They really do look neater. Check out this one on FIM multi-tier with an admin partition:

The larger obstacle to updating the book has been my back – I hurt it last Saturday lifting some furniture. That has made for a difficult time sitting and editing. Nonetheless, I persevere. New target date for release is Monday.
