Ok so [info on the exam and its list of items covered is provided here](http://borntolearn.mslearn.net/btl/b/weblog/archive/2011/07/18/forefront-identity-manager-fim-beta-exam-now-available.aspx)

For fun I thought I would map out the domain objectives to items in the [FIM Best Practices Volume 1](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/fim-best-practices-volume-1-introduction-architecture-and-installation-of-forefront-identity-manager-2010/12917401?productTrackingContext=search_results/search_shelf/center/1)
