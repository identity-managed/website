What a good week â€“ [Insight was awarded Microsoft Desktop Partner of the Year](https://www.insight.com/pages/landingpage.web?id=12933&cm_re=homepage_SMB-_-week26-_-Banner_1), and I just received news of [my MVP award](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile/Lundell) in the Forefront Identity Management area has been renewed.

The Desktop Partner of the Year is a great accomplishment by our Systems Management and Virtualization practice. This one will be added to all of the awards we won as Ensynch:

As for the MVP, I am always honored. I truly enjoy trying to enhance the FIM community. This marks the 6th time I have received the award (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012). There are so many cool experiences I get to have with the the other FIM MVPs, I treasure them.

I look forward to another year of contributions.

PS Look for some book related announcements in the next two weeks.
