Very helpfull!! I was about to block sending emails to disabled accounts - not mailbox but accounts - so I can easily and quick retrieve some data from inactive inboxes. The solution is to create an empty group in AD and set the "dLMemSubmitPerms" parameter to accept messages only from that empty group! Amazing and great many thanks! If somebody else has problem here is the link to the forum with whole conversation -> http://wss.pl/frmThread.aspx?tid=98879

It is helpful. If only provide local AD powershell cmd to run the setting together.  
Thanks.
