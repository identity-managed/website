Both my colleague Brad Turner and I were renewed for ILM MVP.

I am glad to receive this honor another year.

Congrats to new [ILM MVP Marc Mac Donnell](http://assurancesinidentity.blogspot.com/)

You can see a list of all ILM MVP's that have chosen to make their profiles public (Marc hasn't setup his yet).

I just hope I can win the MVP at home!
