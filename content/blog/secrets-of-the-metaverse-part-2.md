Where and how is the Metaverse data stored?

Before I get into that I must caution you that modifying data directly will put you in a position that is unsupported by Microsoft. Even querying the data is something of a touchy issue (see [Part 5](http://blog.ilmbestpractices.com/2013/03/secrets-of-metaverse-part-5.html)).

The Metaverse consists of 5 tables in the FIM Synchronization Service Database:

Table

Comment

mms\_metaverse

Every object in the metaverse has a row in this table. Single-Valued non-reference attributes are stored in this table

mms\_metaverse\_lineagedate

This table has a DateTime column of the same name of every attribute column in the mms\_metaverse table (in other words -- single-valued non-reference attributes).

mms\_metaverse\_lineageguid

This table has a UniqueIdentifier column of the same name of every attribute column in the mms\_metaverse table (in other words -- single-valued non-reference attributes).

mms\_mv\_link

Reference attributes (both single valued and multi-valued) are stored in this table in an Entity Attribute Value format. The references are kept as uniqueIdentifiers

mms\_metaverse\_multivalue

Non-Reference multi-valued attributes are stored in this table in an Entity Attribute Value format (with a column for each of the possible data types)
