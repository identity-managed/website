Did you know that if you subscribe to [Azure AD Premium you also get licenses for FIM](http://windowsitpro.com/identity-management/overview-microsoft-azure-active-directory-premium)? Well if that isn't a hand tipper I don't know what is. I think we can safely assume the next version of FIM will have Azure in the name. Safe or not I am going speculate that it will.  
  
Azure Identity Manager (AIM) -- I would be ok with this  
Azure Role Based Access Manager (ARBAM) -- Explosive sounding name  
Azure Provisioning Engine (APE) -- Please no!!  
Azure Identity Technology (AIT) -- pronounced 8 or aight. Nah.  
Azure Identity Sync Lifecycle Engine (AISLE) -- Certainly when people walk down the aisle they have an identity changing event.  
Azure Identity Lifecycle Management Engine Next Technology (AILMENT). I really hope not we want to cure ailments not install one for you.  
  
My Official guess -- Azure Identity Enhancements (AIE)  
  
Unless we have already seen the new product name -- Azure Active Directory Premium (AADP).  
Maybe the on-premise version will have a slightly different name  
Azure Active Directory Premium On Premises Edition (AAD POPE)  
  
The above has been pure speculation. I have no inside knowledge on the name.
