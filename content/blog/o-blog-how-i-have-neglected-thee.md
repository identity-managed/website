Ok so I have neglected my blog a bit. You all saw the news that Ensynch is now part of Insight.

Wow the same day we announced the merger (9/19), I was also given word that my uncle and cousin died in a plane crash, that wound up making the regional news.

Later my kids earned their trip to Disneyland, so we took them in early October.

One of our architects had to disengage from a _big_ project (for personal reasons) and I needed to step in and play that role too.

Phew! Life has been crazy busy. In reflection I just want to say how precious life and family are to me and hopefully are to each one of you.
