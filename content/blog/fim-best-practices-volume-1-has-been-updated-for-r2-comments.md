Just downloaded the EBook version from Lulu. Would love to see this available in a Kindle (or other e-reader) edition. At the very least, it would be nice to have the PDF re-published to Lulu with the table of contents feature turned on to make it easier to navigate.  
  
Thanks for the great work otherwise.
