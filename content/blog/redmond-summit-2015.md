I am looking forward to presenting in an hour or soÂ on "How Identity Management Impacts the bottom line."  
  
Yesterday I had fun delivering a session on "ADFS vs Password Sync? It depends" This morning Alex Simons of Microsoft revealed a few new things that change some of my advice.  
1) Soon Azure AD can do the location restriction by application for SSO. This potentially eliminates a deal breaker for some people  
2) You can now run Password Sync and ADFS at the same time.  
  
Both of which make it more likely that you will do Password Sync. The second one makes it more likely that you will run both because Password Sync can be a warm standby for failing over from ADFS.
