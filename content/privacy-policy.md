| Personal data collected during delivery of services | We attempt to get rid of personal data as soon as we don't need it anymore to deliver the services needed, such as at the completion of project that has no follow up project. We review annually to eliminate this type of unneeded data. For example, if a file is emailed to us with information about employees that we need to analyze, we would try to delete that data from the email and any of our systems as soon as we don't need it anymore, failing that when we end the project, and failing that during our annual review.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
