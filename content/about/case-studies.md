  headline: User + Group Lifecycle Management
  subhead: Retail (50k + Identities)
  paragraph: We saved this retail company $10â€™s of millions in Office365 license fees, and effort to manage the users, by implementing MIM for Largest Region over 1M identities and 4 additional instances of MIM to manage 6 other regions, which enabled the client to assign different license levels based on job roles and reclaim licenses promptly.
