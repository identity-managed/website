### David Lundell

David got started in technology when his dad brought home first an Atari PC (not the video game console) and later an IBM PC. David picked up a book on programming in BASIC when he was 8. Every week when he was a teenager his dad dragged him into the office of his startup software company to vacuum, clean the bathrooms and haul out the trash. One day his dad handed him the manual for their network management software, sat him down at the computer and commanded, “Test the software!” That was just over 30 years ago.

David worked as a Network and Active Directory Administrator, a .NET Developer, and a SQL Server Database Administrator. He also earned some certifications: MCP, MCSE, MCT, MCDBA, MCSD, MCITP: Database Administrator, MCITP: Database Developer, MCITP: Business Intelligence Developer,  MCSA,  CCNA, CNA, Sun Certified Programmer Java, A+, Network+, Server+.

Then in 2006 David discovered Identity Management and jumped in. While working in other business he built teams of Identity Management Consultants and led and architected projects for organizations big and small, many in the Fortune 500.

S﻿ince founding Identity Managed LLC, David has build Identity Management systems that securely managed more than 2.8 Million Identities for a wide variety of clients.
