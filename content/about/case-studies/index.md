## User + Group Lifecycle Management
#### Retail (50k + Identities)

We saved this retail company $10’s of millions in Office365 license fees, and effort to manage the users, by implementing MIM for Largest Region over 1M identities and 4 additional instances of MIM to manage 6 other regions, which enabled the client to assign different license levels based on job roles and reclaim licenses promptly.

## Custom Azure AD GalSync

#### Research (1k-5k Identities)

Empowered better and more secure collaboration between two divisions of this research company by implementing a Custom Global Address list Synchronization (GalSync) between two Azure Active Directory Tenants (one in GCC High) coming from the same forest using the AADConnect instances for each tenant. This enabled both divisions to see the other division’s users and mailing lists in their own address book, and thus send email more securely and easily.

## GALSync
#### Pro Sports Team

While we can’t take credit for this unnamed team’s resurgence as a playoff contender or improved offense, we can be certain that repairing their Global Address list Synchronization (GalSync) process with the rest of their league enabled them to wheel and deal more securely and more efficiently.
